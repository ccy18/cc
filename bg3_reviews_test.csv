"Overall an outstanding game. Whether it is the voice acting, the variations in character choice, the music or the story - all are at the top of their fields.

"Not for me. Perhaps I didn't get to the hook, but it didn't happen in roughly 12+ hours. For me, too much rolling of dice for every little thing. Someone told me (after I stopped playing) that there's an option to reduce that. Not sure if this is true or not, but I checked the settings back when I was playing and didn't see it. It's possible I missed it, but didn't care to go back and find it. Don't let me ruin your fun if this is what you're into. Loads of people seem to love it, it's just not for me. I really enjoyed Divinity: Original Sin, which I heard was supposed to be super similar to this. It is, but also isn't. I just couldn't get passed the rolling dice every 10 seconds (exaggeration, but also not really).","Jul 09, 2025",steam

"In a year full of ToTK, FFXVI, RE4, Diablo 4, etc. Baldur’s Gate 3 comes out of nowhere and smashes their hopes of winning GOTY. This is a once in a generation game. I envy the people playing their first time from the start. The journey is just amazing, the characters are so well fleshed out, and the world feels alive. The story is great and every single action has a reaction and it’s so good. I hope everyone gives this game a shot. If you thought “turn based games aren’t for me” give it a shot. This one is.","Aug 10, 2023",metacritic
Incredible. One of the best RPG game's I have ever played and an amazing dev team. It really felt like they actually cared about the players experience instead of just profit.

"It took me a while to find my footing with Baldur’s Gate 3. At first, I felt like I was watching someone else’s story—so many systems, so much lore, and a world that didn’t seem to need me. I kept bouncing off it, wondering if maybe it just wasn’t for me. Then I finished Clair Obscur. And something shifted. The tone, the ambiguity, the way it let light and shadow coexist without forcing resolution… it made me realize this wasn’t just a game about choices. It was a game about consequences. About emotional weight. About living with what you’ve done, even when you’re not sure why you did it. Now, I get it. Baldur’s Gate 3 isn’t trying to win you over in the first hour. It’s asking you to stay. To wrestle with it. To let it unfold. And when it does, it’s unforgettable. If you’re someone who needs time to settle into a world—who values emotional texture over instant gratification—give it that time. It’s worth it.","Sep 26, 2025",steam
"For those not versed in the rules and expansive play style options of D&D this game can appear daunting and awkward but the visuals, story, writing, music and performances will quickly grasp you.

"After the two years of owning and playing this game, I find that there's still countless more hours of gameplay left. There is no right or wrong way to play the game, and you can experience a completely unique journey with every new character that you create. The best feature that's been added is the in client mod system, so you don't have to download any 3rd party software. This makes it very easy to play from both PC and Steam Deck, as well as the several other platforms that support the game.","Dec 01, 2025",steam

"Pure gold this is…I remember myself playing Baldurs Gate 2 when I was younger, which was awesome as well….I loved playing Knights of the old Republic, and it feels so good having a game again with the D&D character idea. This game got me hyped up, and I love it. Also how it works on the PS5, still the city needs a FPS update but all in all, this game is such a masterpiece. In no other games you question decisions that much like here. The nightsong quest I needed to restart 3 times to get the right outcome. For all other quests and decisions I leave it running and see what happens when I decide to the best of my knowledge. I am 110 hrs in the game now….there is so much to explore, this is crazy. There are so many moments where you say “wtf”…the dialogs are so well made, the ****. It feels good winning a crucial fight against a boss, when you figured out a good tactic which works out….I could say so much…but this is one of the best games ever made so far.What needs improvement on the PS5 is the FPS level to get 60 all the way and the loading times.I think after my first walk through I will get Divinity Original Sin II – I totally missed that game on my radar. And then a second run in BG3 will follow.A game made with love, without microtransactions, pure story, deep dive in the world – thank you for this!","Oct 24, 2023",metacritic

"I'm leaving a negative review for one very simple reason.... BLOAT Do you REALLY think that it is acceptable for a game to require 150GB install space? Is that what you want out of games going forward? Unoptimized messes? Some are going to say ""but the game is so BIG"". But I don't see how this game is any more impressive than Divinity Original Sin 2 is from a gameplay perspective. Sure, the graphical fidelity is increased and we got cinematic dialogue.... In a CRPG... I'm sorry, those things matter to a CRPG? No, they do not. Fact of the matter is. BG3, even though it is pretty good, is not that much of a massive jump from D:OS2 that it warrants a +130% install size. CRPG's are not supposed to be AAA games. This is bloat. Simple as. There is no other arguing about it. If you think that this is important for a CRPG then you don't like CRPG's in general. You like AAA slop. And if it isn't cinematic then you wouldn't touch it. Game's fine otherwise, gameplay mechanics of D:OS2 is better than BG3. BG3's cinematics makes dialogue more immersive than D:OS2. But is this what I want out of a CRPG? Absolutely not. And do I want bloatware out of ANY game? No. Bloatware is just a sign of developer incompetence to me. I doubt we'll get another good CRPG out of Larian. Next game will probably be 200GB and you lot will probably rationalize why that's fine because we can see the pores on the labia for the sex scenes. :rolleyes:","Jul 20, 2025",steam
"The Best Game Ever Made In my opinion, and from the perspective of an avid gamer, this is the best game ever made. The only thing I dislike is that I fear a game of this quality may never be made again. Whether you're unfamiliar with Dungeons and Dragons, either its world or gameplay, or whether you're an avid fantasy fan, this game is for you. The turn-based roleplay-focused gameplay means even the most casual gamer can enjoy this game, despite its amazing depth. Every element of the world, from the barrels to the monsters, is hand-picked and carefully designed for its place. Enemies are put in positions that allow for unique battle approaches, areas are set up to award exploration and out-of-the-box thinking, and stories are beautifully interwoven with gameplay to make you feel like you are a part of the world. Although its turn-based gameplay may be off-putting to those who prefer more action-packed experiences, I urge those who are wary to take a chance, as Baldur's Gate 3 is amazing whether you enjoy turn-based combat or not. The biggest issues you may face are likely going to be due to inherent shortcomings of the Dungeons and Dragons format, which although is not the game's fault, can be a detractor. In specific, the RNG-based attacks and spells can be annoying, and the disparity between caster and martial classes is frustrating. The characters are, perhaps, the best part of Baldur's Gate 3 and what really ties everything together. Every NPC in the game, from your party companions to random townsfolk, are unique and exciting, and make you want to continue playing to further your interactions with them. I feel that even the most disconnected players will become enthralled with the characters and their story. Even after competing the game once, I feel that there is a lot of potential for further playthroughs; and this is coming from someone who abhors doing things all over again. You could do the classic evil/good playthrough, venture out with a different set of companions, experience what it's like to be as different classes with unique builds, or even just go through and try things you may have missed or approach encounters in different ways. All in all, Baldur's Gate 3 is a masterpiece of a game and one I believe will go down in history as being a monument to what makes video games great in the future.","Nov 25, 2025",steam

"At first i thought this game is full of crap because it won the GOTY 2023, i look the game up its a weird turn based game with D&D mechanic that i never heard. It look so boring af very boring, i look up the review, the video gameplay its so idk boring af but then im curious whats so good about this game so i decided to buy this game for myself during Christmas Sales. Update: still the best Once i played the game i was sooooooo into it and it change my mind of how good this game really is to the point i uninstall all my games just to free some space to download and play this game. Game so addictive for some reason, i played alot of single player games include gacha games most of em just so easily burnt out for example i bought Far Cry 4 and only have 81 minutes, forgor to refund but its just there never be played ever again cause how boring it is. But this game is so good enough to the point i ignore all my friends just to enjoy the full immersive RPG goofy ahh games, is a game that i really craving for so long after Cyberpunk 2077(disappointed on the first day and game expensive af) . Making my own decision, go with my own style and flow of the game, and have the opportunity to be the good and bad guy at the same time. In conclusion, by far the best game i've ever played for so long after Fallout 4, GTA 5, and RD2. Good Story, Good Character, Plenty of choices (that cyberpunk 20777 cant achieve) recommend all single player rpg gamers out there should try this game as well even though it looks boring and goofy and D&D mechanic sounds stupid, but it change my mind in instant as soon i played it eggnore my bed english","Mar 31, 2025",steam

"I didn't like the game at first. It seemed like everything was taking too long and actions were too limited. I also didn't like the D20 dice and I swear the game has them weighted toward the lower end on tactician difficulty. Anyway, I gave it another shot and this time it grabbed me. It gets a lot better as you level up and get new abilities. Not only is combat more fun, but you can start to do things the way you want to instead of being railroaded into doing them a certain way like you are in the early game. I'd say this change is most apparent after making level 4. I also installed a mod that replenishes spells during short rest and that was very helpful. Not having to go back to camp and long rest after every big fight is very nice.","Feb 14, 2025",steam

"I do reccomend this game but I also want to make some suggestions to players and devs. Difficulty level even on easy is incredibly hard. Your best bet as a player is to download mods to ease that difficulty and to save often, every five minutes to be exact or every ten. Especially before and after every dialogue if character progression matters to you. I feel like a lot of emphasis is put on characters who are extremely annoying to me, Shadowheart, is absolutely my very least favorite. I also want to tell the devs they took the freedom out of evil play with happy endings away from us as players. Every evil playthrough will have a terrible ending. some say it's just right for an evil playthrough to have a bad ending, but for players who want to be evil, why do the devs have to focus on such disney-esque endings and for villains, we get nothing? Otherwise a stellar game. Needs a better map system because I am constantly getting lost and having to watch Ytube for puzzle solving. I get it, D&D has puzzles but that is why D&D online failed. Too many damn puzzles that needed multiple players to solve. If you are going to create a free open world let us enjoy it - without so much difficulty. 8/10","May 21, 2025",steam

Absolutely amazing game. The amount of choice in this game is incredible and very impressive. Apart from some occasional bugs which is considered normal in today’s gaming industry this game doesn’t have any issues I can see personally. Only recently got into CRPG games but this is a massive step up in production value compared to the others. Highly recommend to any RPG fan or fans of classic BioWare.,"Sep 6, 2023",metacritic

"I went into Baldur’s Gate 3 unsure what to expect, as this genre of game has never really been my thing. However, I was completely blown away. From the beautifully crafted world to the engaging storytelling, this game hooked me in a way I didn’t think possible. The depth of the characters, the freedom to make meaningful choices, and the tactical combat system turned what seemed intimidating at first into a deeply rewarding experience. The game challenged me to think in new ways, and it opened my eyes to the appeal of this genre. Now, not only do I love Baldur’s Gate 3, but I’ve also grown to appreciate role-playing games on a whole new level. Whether you're a seasoned CRPG fan or a complete newbie like I was, this game is an absolute must-play. Larian Studios has truly set a new standard for storytelling and immersion!","Dec 05, 2024",steam

"I finally finished the game so this review has been a long time coming. I love this game. Everything about this game is well thought out and the years it put in towards making it have paid off in such a wonderful experience. I got the game shortly after it was released and to see it improve with the updates it has had just tells me how much Larian Studios cares about their work. It's no secret that this game can be awesome when modded, but even without mods it's still an amazing play. The voice acting of the characters is amazing, the stories themselves are amazing, even the play style is amazing. This is also a wonderful introduction to DND if you or a friend are having a hard time figuring out the mechanics. I've played DND for a long time and this game helped me visualize things as a player. There are lots of secret dialogue and choices you can make based upon your race and class and I'm really happy they took the time and effort to do that. Finishing the game finally made me burst into tears, it was so rewarding and so bittersweet to see that end credit screen. This is a game that is so much fun to be replayed as a different race and class every time. This is my favorite game by far and despite it's cost, it is so worth the money.","Feb 16, 2025",steam
"This game is like taking a road trip with the most unhinged individuals on the planet you can tell every character individually is holding back saying a Marvel one liner at every individual second. This is if thunderbolts*/guardians of the Galaxy was a video game. Combat is fun is really hard, The setting is a little generic but that’s more do to D&D Soundtrack does its job but it’s overall forgettable. This is more into personal experience But dyslexia functionality is lacking and add a lot of time to my play through. I think the main draw of this game is the writing and incredible characters who are voice acted incredibly I think anyone who enjoys strategy games or a bizarre group of characters trying to save the world i’d recommend this game. (Edit i’m still going to leave the review as positive because it’s all my genuine opinion about the game but they use gen AI and if I knew that information before buying it I wouldn’t have played it)","May 30, 2025",steam

"Even with the little amount of time I've put into this game, the visuals and story telling are so beautiful.

"A real GEM in our times. Solid RPG with ROLE PLAYING, with CHARACTERS, with CHOICES and CO-OP. That's like a game from the best times of RPGs. I just hope that Larian will get a possibility to work on TES, Fallout, Vampire and some cyberpunk/space titles. Hard to tell anything about the game that stands unbelievably higher than anything from past 5 years, maybe even 10. Have beaten it together with my wife, had only a few minor bugs after reload inside dialogues, but that's all. The only real downside I can say (for me) is a system take from DnD. All those types of spells that can be used indefinitely/only x times before long rest/only x times before short rest... Is a bit too much of a complication with no real reason. But I see why it may be needed - to push players back to the camp, because a lot of things happen only there :) Anyway, after few hours system becomes more or less usable without serious problems. In an era of mobile gaming with awful monetization, endless ""dlcs"" that are only skin packs, season passes with some dlcs missing, season YEARLY passes, endless extraction shooters, boosters in single player and all that ****.. Larian just gave a huge slap over all other companies that are killing the industry. Good job. And best of luck. That's what really is a 10/10 game.","Jan 02, 2025",steam

"To preach to the choir, I like this game a lot! There's an opportunity to make a meaningful decision around every corner in this densely packed game world. A lot of care has been put until the ""flourish""-y details such as animation and voice acting. You won't have to waste time on endless traveling, it's just straight roleplay and classic CRPG combat. And there's a nice balance between humor and drama that I don't see a lot of these days in any sort of media, not just video games. You do have to be comfortable with, or at least be willing to tolerate: -Dice rolls around every corner, in and out of combat -Overcoming decision paralysis and the temptation to endlessly savescum -A noticeable degree of unapologetic horniness in the writing. Mostly leaving this review because of my very Nice playtime.","Apr 16, 2025",steam

"I've been a gamer most of my life, and given my age, I've had the ""sweet spot"" when it comes being the right age for developing games. I grew up on the now-nostalgic OGs like Tomb Raider and DOOM, experienced the brutal MW2 lobbies at their peak, and the joys of awing at developing modern graphics. With this, it's unfair to say any one game is ""the best I've ever played"" because it's apples and oranges. But this game, this freaking game, has broken my perception. This is hands-down the best game I have ever played.","Sep 21, 2025",steam

Honestly I don't care about homosexuality or crossdressers in games, as long as they are normal people like in BG3 so thumbs up for making those characters not any more special than any other character. Lesbians are always a welcome sight and having a futa action will always cheer my heart. Now showing trans characters as something good is just encouraging mental illness.","Aug 21, 2023",metacritic
"I will absolutely play this game again, and I can also recommend it for purchase. Baldur’s Gate 3 is a true masterpiece that sets a new standard for the RPG. Every moment in the game is filled with attention to detail, and the story branches are so varied that you immediately want to replay the whole journey in a different way. But the most impressive part is the characters. Every playable character is unique, deeply written, and remarkable in their own way. Their stories are captivating, their motivations feel real, and interacting with them is genuinely enjoyable. It's rare to find a game where you become so attached to the entire party. The combat system shines with its tactical depth, and the world is rich, beautiful, and full of secrets to uncover. You can truly feel the freedom of choice: every decision leaves a meaningful mark on how the adventure unfolds, making each playthrough a one-of-a-kind experience. Larian Studios have created a dream game, and now all that’s left is to hope that Divinity: Original Sin 3, if it ever comes to life, will be just as stunning, vibrant, and profound. If BG3 is the benchmark for future RPGs, then the genre's future looks truly brilliant.","Nov 27, 2025",steam

"200 hours and FINALLY beat this behemoth of a game. I doubt I need to say all that much, as I'm sure by now you'd have seen the countless positive reviews from basically everyone since release. What I will say is this; The writing, voice-acting, and narrative are all top-notch quality, and the gameplay itself - with its depth of mechanics, builds, and choices - is insanely good. As someone who's not usually into Fantasy (apart from Witcher 3 ofc), it definitely did feel like a bit of a slog to reach the end of the game, since there's just SO much content, so many locations, quests, and things to do - but I'm definitely glad I stuck it through. It was a very satisfying ending to a long and epic adventure, and was great seeing all the various companions and characters get their happy endings. The epilogue party was especially cool. No doubt at all - this game has hundreds, if not thousands, of hours in replay value, especially for Fantasy/D&D/cRPG fans. Totally think it's a game that everyone should play at least once. 9.5/10","May 06, 2025",steam

It adapts DnD mechanics well, so if you are familiar with tabletop Dungeons and Dragons, many things will seem familiar.

"I have wanted this game for monthhhhhsss, and I thought I couldn't get it on my (relatively) old MacBook Air, but I finally got it and I am so happy. It is everything I hoped it would be- with ONE exception: the camera controls for the MacBook mean that you can't toggle the ""height (angle? pitch axis?)"" of the camera. It's really hard to look into spaces and see where you are going because of this. I understand there is a mod for computers with Windows, but it's frustrating this isn't built in as standard for the game, and also isn't available for MacBooks (although, yes I know, MacBook Air isn't really built for these kinds of games). It would also be useful to have an initial trial option for different classes during character creation, so that you can try out the combat styles for different classes and see if you like it before committing to starting a game. In addition, it would be helpful to have a tutorial section on exactly how combat and building a character works in a slow, very broken-down, idiot-proof way. You can absolutely still enjoy the game and play well without this kind of tutorial but I found when I watched some YouTube videos that did do the job of breaking down how to understand what each spell or attack actually achieves I enjoyed the game a lot more because I wasn't making ""blind"" decisions with the limited information I had available from just trial and error of playing. This difference became more clear when I was helping someone else on their first time playing because each time I would point something out or explain something they would go ""oh well that's not very intuitive, is it?"". I do believe in trial and error making things more fun in a game, and also that certain aspects of optimising the game experience should involve further reading and engaging in classic game nerd discussions (e.g., stats building, spell/weapon comparisons, lore, hacks, easter eggs, etc.), but it is frustrating that further reading should be needed from the outset of playing as a beginner in order to understand what you're doing at a basic enough level to not feel like you're blindly wandering around. I know that seems like a hefty set of complaints, but I really do want to emphasise that this game is fun! I haven't played any computer games in almost 10 years, and was always more of an MMORPG kind of person, and this game is everything I want from a fantasy RPG. I love the environment, it is beautiful; I love all the characters' personalities; I love the gameplay, and I love the flexibility.","Mar 25, 2025",steam

"I’ve played Baldur’s Gate 3 quite a bit now, and honestly, it’s one of the best RPG experiences I’ve ever had. The story completely pulls you in — every choice feels like it matters, and the characters are so well-written that I found myself actually caring about what happened to them. What really stands out to me is how immersive it is. You don’t just play through a set story; you live in it. Whether it’s dialogue, exploration, or combat, everything flows together so naturally that I’d catch myself losing track of time. The turn-based combat is another highlight. It feels smooth and strategic without ever dragging on, which is rare in games like this. Every encounter gave me different ways to approach it, and that freedom kept battles from ever feeling stale. Overall, BG3 is easily a masterpiece. If you’re even slightly into RPGs, this game is worth diving into.","Sep 07, 2025",steam

"Baldur’s Gate 3 is a nice game, but I think I prefer Divinity: Original Sin 2 in terms of character design, worldbuilding, and especially combat. Playing BG3 made me realize that I really dislike D&D's approach to magic, it feels restrictive and disjointed. The spell slot system discourages me from using the big, flashy spells I enjoy, and the magic schools feel like arbitrary categories rather than cohesive playstyles. Unlike DOS2, where elemental magic offers a clear identity and fun synergies, D&D's spell list feels like a grab bag of effects with little overarching logic. Even at high levels, magic rarely delivers a true power fantasy unless you use a handful of standout spells, and too many cool abilities are situational or impractical. While I appreciate BG3's strong character interactions, its combat system ultimately left me frustrated rather than empowered.","Apr 01, 2025",steam
Larian Studios knocked it out of the park again. Baldur's Gate 3 gives you boundless options from character customization and choices to make during your journey. It has a fantastic and immersive story. If you buy this game know that you are getting a full product from the start and not a broken product riddled with micro transactions designed to deprive you of as much of your money as possible while providing you with as little as possible. As far as I am concerned Baldur's Gate 3 is the gold standard for RPG games and furthermore serves as an indictment of the AAA game studios that consistently shovel out inferior quality games for exorbitant amounts of money.,"Aug 11, 2023",metacritic

"I’ve always loved gaming but over the years of developers pumping out half baked games for an absurd amount and adding in paid for DLC to make it minutely better I became less interested; BG3 has truly made me fall back in love with games. It’s difficult to find a game you can feel fully immersed in and yet with the beautifully written characters backed by the voice actors who did an amazing job, the environment that you can interact with in its entirety, hundreds of hours of playtime, a beautiful soundtrack, not to mention the jam packed story and the ability to make choices that actually matter. BG3 is a testament to games and deserves every praise it has, is and will receive. Truly an outstanding game.","Nov 17, 2023",metacritic

"Baldur's Gate 3 is a huge title for me, tho it is not quite flawless! I fully believe for anyone who likes to play RPG's this game is an absolute must play. This game is so freakin good! Act I and II are pretty much A tier linear questing. There are a few different orders you can engage certain content but mostly there is a progression to the acts otherwise. I feel like the quality of the game up to the point you find the Nightsong is some of the best content of all times list material. The quality after I feel like is severely diminished and feels somewhat thrown together. Baldurs Gate, the city is absolutely stunning, but I feel like the content does not feel as exciting as you might expect I feel like most of the firepower is in the first two acts. What you get with this game is a very gritty, sexy, cute, playful, serious, dark, loveable, every kinda vibe you can think of but otherwise very adult game that lets you enjoy it however you like, for the most part with many exceptions and sometimes plain silly bugs. It is a game that I think will have replay value for a long time to come. I rate this alongside games that sit on my all times list, like the witcher 3, bioshock infinite, ocarina of time, windwaker, definitely a favorite. Ive played through the game 3 times, definitely going to again!","Dec 27, 2025",steam

From the moment you step into the world, it’s clear this game is a love letter to fans of classic computer RPGs and tabletop roleplayers alike. The writing and world-building are exceptional—deep, rich, and easy to get lost in. The lore is layered and rewarding, whether you're a veteran D&D player or new to the Forgotten Realms. Every choice matters, every path feels unique, and the replayability is off the charts. What truly sets BG3 apart is its characters. They’re not just companions—they feel alive. The voice acting is top tier, breathing soul and nuance into each conversation and interaction. It’s rare to find a game where I care this much about the party I travel with.

"Baldur’s Gate 3 – A Masterclass in Modern RPGs Baldur’s Gate 3 is one of those rare games that truly delivers on the promise of giving players freedom and immersion in a living, breathing world — and it does so with style. One of the first things that hits you is just how excellent the voice acting and direction are. Every major and minor character feels authentic, their performances bringing out genuine emotion and nuance. You’re not just hearing lines — you’re feeling what the characters want you to feel, whether that’s tension, heartbreak, camaraderie, or pure dread. It adds an incredible layer of immersion that few RPGs manage to hit consistently. Another huge plus is how approachable this game is for newcomers. If this is your first foray into the Baldur’s Gate series (or even Dungeons & Dragons), don’t worry — this is a completely standalone story set in the universe of other standalone stories. There’s no required homework here. Veterans will catch references and Easter eggs, but new players can dive in and enjoy a complete experience on its own merits. Combat is a highlight in its own right. The turn-based system is incredibly fun, rewarding both tactical thinking and creative problem-solving. On higher difficulties, it provides an exceptional challenge for those wanting to test their mettle — you will need to think several moves ahead. On the flip side, if you just want to feel like an unstoppable force, playing on lower difficulties is very forgiving. In fact, on lower settings, it’s not uncommon to see enemies and even bosses get reduced to one-tap territory — so the game really lets you choose your power fantasy level. Speaking of which, the custom difficulty options are fantastic. The ability to tailor your experience down to the smallest details — like how the bartering and trade system functions — is one of those quality-of-life features that every RPG should take note of. You can shape the game around exactly how you want to play, and that level of flexibility is a huge win. A personal favorite touch: the mod manager built into the game. Huge shout-out to the devs for making it so smooth — no digging through folders or downloading from third-party sites. You can grab what you want directly through the game, which lowers the barrier to entry and encourages players to experiment and customize. More games should follow this example. Finally, character customization and class progression are very solid. Whether you want to min-max or roleplay a quirky build, the tools are here, and they feel meaningful. As your character grows, choices matter — both mechanically and narratively — which only deepens your investment in your party and their journey. Final Verdict: Baldur’s Gate 3 is a modern RPG done right: immersive, flexible, approachable, and packed with heart. Whether you’re a newcomer or a veteran, a story-driven player or a tactical combat fiend, this game delivers. It’s not just a great Baldur’s Gate game — it’s one of the best RPGs of its generation.

"ENGLISH Baldur’s Gate 3 isn’t just a good RPG — it’s an absolute masterclass. The writing is incredibly rich, every choice truly matters, and the game constantly manages to surprise you, even after dozens of hours. The gameplay perfectly blends the depth of Dungeons & Dragons with the accessibility of a modern video game. Turn-based combat is demanding but deeply rewarding, and every situation can be approached in countless ways: diplomacy, stealth, or just sending in the big barbarian to smash through the door. Each companion has a strong, memorable personality, to the point where you genuinely grow attached to them (or sincerely hate them). And the presentation… cinematic, movie-level quality, while still giving you complete freedom. FRENCH Baldur’s Gate 3 n’est pas juste un bon RPG : c’est une masterclass absolue. L’écriture est d’une richesse incroyable, chaque choix compte vraiment, et le jeu arrive à surprendre constamment, même après des dizaines d’heures. Le gameplay mélange à la perfection la profondeur de Donjons & Dragons et l’accessibilité d’un jeu vidéo moderne. Les combats au tour par tour sont exigeants mais gratifiants, et chaque situation peut être résolue de mille façons : diplomatie, infiltration, ou gros barbare qui traverse la porte. Chaque compagnon a une personnalité marquante, au point que tu t’attaches (ou détestes) sincèrement chacun d’eux. Et la mise en scène… digne d’un film, mais avec ta liberté totale derrière.","Sep 27, 2025",steam

"Man, this is one of those time when I wish steam had a middleground option rather than just recomend or don't. It's... ok. Honestly the more I get back to it and try to play it, the more I start to believe the people that say this only blew up because of the high production values, which while that can be a nice bonus, is on the bottom of the list for things I care about in a good game. The story is... fine. It's fairly generic DnD, and theres not enough choice variation outside of a few quest to make it interesting to me. The mechanics and system are based off a far too simplified version of DnD to the point where it's just kind of boring. Divinity Original Sin 2 had more build diversity and mechanics than this game. Honestly every time I play this I kind of just wish I was playing that instead. The setting is far more unique and interesting too. Weird skinny elves that absorb memories through eating other living beings? I'll take that any day over generic, pretty high elf and drow tropes. The writing is ok, for the most part, but it just feels servicable. The voice acting and constant cutscenes just detract from the experience for me. Everyone talks so SLOW compared to my reading speed, and the facial animations are crazy awkward to the point of breaking immersion. I do not get the praise on that aspect, the flaws in character animations show up as early as the prologue. The characters aren't even all that interesting compared to other crpgs. If anything, I find them fairly basic and boring for the most part. Even the ones I find ok are just that, ok. Artorius is probably the best of the bunch if I had to pick someone. I try to give the game a shot but I get bored and burn out by mid game. Every time I play this I just wish I was playing an Owlcat rpg or something. I could stay engrossed in Warhammer Roguetrader through an entire playthrough for 270ish hours and not get bored once, despite it being my first 40k game, but I struggle to keep intrest in Balders Gate 3 long enough to even get halfway through. I have to give props to the devs for all the updates they've put into the game sense launch, credit where it's due and all. But man, I just do not get the appeal to this game. I'm just going to have to accept that I'm the odd one out on this title.","Dec 11, 2025",steam

"I really tried to try a new game. This game seemed to be loved by a particular niche. Having paid full price off the hype I’d recommend against playing it. Just watch it online if you want the story. Cause the gameplay **** for me and is so convoluted and confusing. The movement is extremely slow throughout the map which was a problem for me even in Pokémon and other similar games but the story makes up for it. I’m also pissed cause a glitch cost me a weapon I spent so long to find and my squad was weaker in every single fight after. I liked the story so far but it all seems consequential. If you’re into this type of game or DnD you’ll love it. For me, I got to the end of act 2 and put it down I hate this game. It frustrated me throughout and the story feels inconsequential. This game gets overwhelming positivity for some reason idk. For me, it **** ****. For someone else, this might be the best game ever cause they enjoy these type of things. Also it’s very easy to make fake metacritic accounrs and bot spam boost reviews. I’m not saying that they’re doing that just that it is. Keep that in mind before you buy off the hype. For reference I enjoyed cyberpunk more. Even Jedi survivor. Its just not my thing and the grind and main fun parts of the game **** to me. It seems like a pointless investment of mashing buttons that makes me question life. All while letting 90% of the story bore me. In the end I tried out a game randomly and I hated it but I loved the Witcher 3 when I did that. So whatever do you","Dec 30, 2023",metacritic

"I played this for about an hour and fell asleep half way through and cant give it back because the text was campy and dragged out that again literally made me fall asleep. The gameplay feels really clunky and boring. In my head all I can think about is wow Fire Emblem 3DS and Switch was just this but so much better. After I tried to plea with steam to give it back and explain why I exceeded the 2 hours I tried to give it one more shot. The button layouts and just clunky gameplay made me skip turns. Not to mention healing is basically worthless since you get a certain amount of mana so there goes my cleric build spending more than 30 mins creating a character with the most throat punching character creation ive been dealt with. the perks and others skills that you can add on from the beginning was just not explained that much more so told and if tried in battle it does whatever and youve wasted that mana. Fire Emblem was more engaging than this and someone who likes that kind of combat sad to see its lazily done with basic character movements and now fluidity and camera movements. The worst part why I cant get through this game is you cant skip the enemy attacking you or make it faster. you have to watch through the whole thing making fights last so much longer and if youre dying or like me getting used to combat and your characters will get hurt. I wanted to like this game because I love DND, but I went into this game completely blind and I shouldve done my research first without letting my love for DND blindside me. The dialogue is boring, the gameplay is boring, getting through the map is so slow, a 3ds game from more than 10 years ago made this type of gameplay and game just so much more better. The dialogue in that game was more engaging than here and theres no voices! And I have a theory as to why that is. its because the characters are bland and 1 dimensional. you have angry warrior lady, sarcastic warrior lady, horny vampire. Theres no depth unless you sit through most of the dialogue which is more than half of the game.","Nov 21, 2025",steam

"Baldur's Gate 3 is the CRPG masterpiece we've all been waiting for-a sprawling D&D epic that reinvents the genre with a fresh, player-driven story packed with moral ambiguity, hilarious companions, and gut-wrenching choices that ripple across 100+ hours of play. The narrative takes the classic Baldur's Gate formula and infuses it with cerebral horror: you're infected with a mind flayer tadpole, racing to cure it while navigating alliances with devils, gods, and goblins. It's bold, reactive, and never predictable. Animation is next-level-fluid combat, expressive faces during cutscenes, and those tiny idle animations that make the world feel alive. Voice acting is phenomenal: every line, from Astarion's silky sarcasm to Shadowheart's quiet intensity, is delivered by pros who elevate the script to Shakespearean heights. Gameplay blends deep tactics, exploration, and romance into pure addiction. It's dense, but the freedom is intoxicating. 9.5/10-Larian redefined RPGs. Play it now.","Nov 28, 2025",steam

"Hands down an amazing and lovely game. The game is really pretty with breathtaking graphics and great world details, like birdsi n the background playing to catch seeds. The amount of stuff they prepared for the dialogues is amazing. Every possible situation - there's a line there for it. The locations are cool which is strengthened by the fact you can sneak in almost everywhere due to multiple paths being available to you. Most battles are well-designed and balanced allowing challenge where needed and leniency where sought. The satisfaction of levelling up and building the character is extremely high and can't be understated - I loved building my character up. Insanely epic Raphael fight as well as the last fight. The soundtracks were thorugh the roof! The ending is incredible and satisfying and the romancing in the game is an amazing feature. That being said, there were a couple of negative aspects to the game which I remember. Critical failures have to go - they are a bane of all the builds. Some things just aren't left to luck, as in you can't suddenly sound less imposing due to... luck? Bugs have not been properly addressed, like the ""no action in combat bug"" which I only had once but it was really annoying. Jaheira in the dialogue within the inn knows you have an artifact even if you keep it in secret from her earlier at the gates. You can't tell Isobel about killing the mage in Act 3, even if you have done so with Aylin - these dialogue mistakes broke immersion and honestly - made some part of gameplay leading thereto quite less meaningful. Can't save in Oubliette (this blocks the ability to save game forever, error 804) - another bug which almost ended my playthrough and I know for a fact many people did away with the game because of it. Zrell fight - auto-crits on Absolute paladins? Seriously? I replayed the fight four times and they persisted. Exxvikyap just ends the dialogue if you tell her the monk dialogue option - this is just funny. You can't activate Call Lightning while in Wild Shape - what the heck? Why would they do this thing to the Druids? It's an important part of the kit, always has been. Some textures are extremely low-quality in several shots, notably outside of the dialogues. (Spoiler!!!!) The game makes you believe stuff which isn't true - like ""you are on a timer"" and ""the world will end tomorrow"" basically. Which makes you spend less time long-resting, leading to less dialogues and similar encounters. Too many weird ♥♥♥♥ in quests require you to google stuff - like Arabella disappearing and bugging out if you did not speak to her at one particular point no one tells you about. Dream Visitor can't be killed and Astral Prism can't be given out which makes the story incredibly linear and lame at first. The Chosen just explain their plot out loud... lacking any means of perception to notice us crouching behind some crap and riding a whole elevator to get there. These are just plotholes everybody chose to ignore when designing the game. Every save weighs a ton which is not a problem until you log out of a gaming session and have to upload them via steam for 10-15 minutes, which is annoying. But not nearly as annoying as Shroud Self + Sanctuary cultists - not strong or difficult to deal with, just irritating Tolna Tome-Monger can target you with Disintegrate through the roof and walls, but god forbid you try to target comeone through a barrel. Puzzles like in Sorcerous Vault are the type of ""we never state the key, so just mash the buttons"" which is not fun The cutscene after telling the ""Avenge the Drowned"" questgiver you killed the beastmaster is bugged - no lines appear. The pathfinding in the game is ludicrous. A ton of times my character would be like ""Oh yeah, let me autofind the path to this secret location, but yeah, I can't jump across the hall, I'll get stuck in the chandelier"". Wyll does not acknowledge his father is saved until you actually talk to him The enemy has Motivators. What are we going to do once we got rid of some of them, secured the place and brought our families to safety? Keep wearing the collars and die like slaves, that's right. The amount of xp you get and don't need is staggering. Why not just make two more levels, up to 14? This last thing made me scratch my head so many times. This much content in Act 3 for... these few levels? Ridiculous. But overall - a lovely game which I hope will get more polished in the future. This gave me so many good memories and helped spend time in a really fun way.","Aug 19, 2025",steam
"I'm sorry. I wanted to like this game, but it just isn't all that. Big and long for the sake of being long, with a world that doesn't feel connected. Every place feels like it exists in a vaccum. It's nowhere near as good as Planescape or Classic Fallout, which to me are the pinacles of RPG storytelling and worldbuilding. As for the gameplay, I like it more than BG1, not as much as classic Fallout. When it's not excrusiatingly difficult it's repetiive, when it's not repetivtive it's ungoldly difficult and the only way to win is to come up with cheese strategies like luring the enemy to NPC's so they can fight for you. I'll probably still keep playing just because I get bored these days but man I can not play for more than 30 minutes before I stop and play something else","Sep 06, 2025",steam

"So much has been said about this game already, so I'll try to make this brief. I really, really DISLIKE Dungeons & Dragons. To me it's campy, uninspired, and uninteresting. A kind of generic fantasy setting full of worn-out tropes and inspirations that are so low-bar and in-your-face, it sometimes beggars belief. But Baldur's Gate 3 is fantastic. I'm 62 hours in and I can't get enough. The storytelling is great. The dialogues are mostly excellent. The voice acting is amazing. The gameplay is terrific. I turn off the music in most modern games because usually it's just so bad (and I'm a melomaniac), but the music in this game is simply beautiful. I constantly find myself shaking my head in amazement at how good some of those tracks are. So, yeah. All those glowing reviews aren't lying. This one is really that good. EDIT#1: The writing takes a nosedive in Act 3; both story-wise, and in dialogues. I find myself skipping some of the talking. The shortcomings of the setting (D&D itself) are also becoming exacerbated. EDIT#2: The final stages, the climax, the ending, and the epilogue were as generic, boring, lazy and underwhelming as any run-of-the-mill fantasy RPG from the last 20 years. Wholly unworthy of the excellent first two acts. What an absolute and utter disappointment. Perhaps it is a testament to the banality of Dungeons & Dragons itself — whatever one tries to do to elevate the source material into something better, its triviality always ends up being a glass ceiling no medium can ever hope to transcend. I'm positive this wouldn't have been the case if pen-and-paper Warhammer were to receive the Larian treatment. Of course one can only dream...","Sep 15, 2025",steam

"I have played the game for over 100 hours and am currently in ACT 2. Here are my thoughts: Combat is very slow and not exciting. Yeah, it's from D&D, but it didn't have to be in my opinion. Exploration is tedious and slow. Mods can help with that. You don't feel like you are the character you made. Character creation is very limited, it's just presets. Mods can help with adding more, but i.g. it's pretty lame. Every character is voice, but the one that you play. In a story driven game, that is minus point. SWTOR did it and it's an MMO. The Story so far has been pretty good. Many of the main characters start out being insufferable, especially Astarion, but they all seem to have a pretty well-written character and story. The overall story and how the side missions merge into the main story is well done. You won't really find yourself going away to do all the side missions and then continue on the main story, but rather most of the side missions are on the way of the main mission. Lastly, the puzzles are horrendous, the worst I have ever seen. Mostly you have to find some other detail in some book you might or might not have picket up somewhere or there's a hint anywhere on the room, that you might not see. Some of them are luckily bypassable by automatically succeeding a perception check to reveal a button on the wall, that just skips the whole thing, but it doesn't really make the puzzle any better. When there isn't such an option it can get very frustrating: In the Gauntlet there is this labyrinth puzzle, where you just die, when you misstep. Which is very costly in this game. Even with all the hints in the room, completing it, is guess work, and the cost of failure. Well realistly it's a reload, which makes this whole experience not rewarding. You can't skip it with dimension door either, cause everything is shrouded in darkness, so your character can't see it. Tldr: The story and characters are amaizing. The gameplay is pretty bad however, which makes for a grueling experience to get through the story.","Jun 11, 2025",steam
"What can I say? I want to like it. I really do. There are parts of it I do actually enjoy. But overall, this is very much not the game for me. Act 1 had me hooked. Act 2 had me slightly annoyed. Act 3 was bad enough I had to mod it to finish it. The camera is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nightmare, the combat feels like a slog through molasses, the RNG definetly favors the enemies. The fact I had to do almost two hours of prep work and research to make it through one large combat encounter, on Explorer mode, broke me. I played D&D 5e for awhile before I started BG3, and while I do enjoy the world building and the roleplaying aspects for the most part, the combat is honestly the worst part of this game. Theres literally no justifiable reason my entire beefed up squad with meta gear and stats should struggle with a group of lizard people, on the games easiest difficulty. The only workaround Ive found that takes the combat from nearly an hour per conflict (obviously dependant on size of enemy group) is to cheese the ♥♥♥♥ out of items and set up a trap guantlet before starting the combat. Which, if I was playing on hard or above, I could respect. But I wasnt. Overall, BG3 had great potential for being one of the better games Ive played, but quality of life and combat/balancing issues abound doesnt make me want to play this game ever again. Finishing it felt like a chore and frankly thats just not fun.","Nov 22, 2025",steam
"Very good game, it does actually live up to the hype for the most part. Played it several times including a completed honour mode run, however the game does have some very glaring flaws. Pros: - Story is brilliant, the main story is the weakest part, the game shines in the side characters and companions and everything they bring. - Combat is very good if you like turn based systems, character customisation and gear hunting. This game really rewards creativity and exploration, there is build defining gear everywhere. Be aware that the games combat and systems very quickly break down when you start finding these items - even in the hardest difficulty you can fast approach optimisation of one-round murdering major bosses, so depending on what you want in a game then you may consider this a balancing issue. In general - glass cannon is the way to play this game. - I didn't expect this game to be as funny as it is, a lot of credit needs to go to the writing department and the voice acting. These are the things that truly, truly carry this game. Cons: - The UI in this game is very weak around anything to do with inventory, so many restrictions and things that should be able to happen seemingly not working. You can only stack items in the store menu if you're using the character you're in the store for, despite the fact it loads all inventories. Organisation is also a complete mess - however is solved by mods for containers and organisation. Items also have no item description flags without mods, there is seemingly hundreds of items in this game and it is hard to tell which of them are useful or not, especially if they are miscalanious, simple coloured backgrounds or borders would of sufficed. I believe in the ethos that if I have to google what a misc item is for then the game has failed in it's delivery of information. There is a half way point between what I would want and what the game gives me that would of been a lot better than what we got. - Bugs: This is honestly the big one for me. For a game this large and looked after, I am very dissapointed in how many bugs are in this game. In my Honour mode runs I was tasked with dealing with the consequences of game-changing and run altering unexpected bugs, this shouldn't be a feature. It can be from falling through the floor and dying. NPC's not behaving as you'd expect of them, or things disappearing. Every time I encountered something I thought was a bug a quick google confirmed to me that I wasn't stupid, I didn't make a narrative mistake, and it was bugged for the sake of being bugged. - The camera. Honestly, I find that it sucks. It's especially bad in one of the final dungeons of act 2 running and jumping down a slope. It is aggregiously bad when you have fights inside buildings. I hope the devs take a lesson from XCOM for this and introduce a ""level-up"" and ""level-down"" button for when you are dealing with heights, I think it desperately needs it. - For a game of this scope and size the character customisation is frankly quite bad, I expected a lot better customisation options than the ones we got, mods thankfully fix this. - No achievements when you use mods. I get it, some of them are stupid, feels like some more nuance could of been taken with this in a way to flag aestetic/UI mods to not disable achievements. Did my second playthrough with UI and Inventory mods and it disabled my achievements. I do feel a bit robbed because these were the things I had my major gripes with in the game and I would of liked to get them without having to struggle through dealing with the vanilla inventory system. Personal gripe: I think the EXP balancing in this game is very unrewarding. Playing ""thin"" in this game power levels you to level cap with absolute ease and nothing ever level or gear checked me that I ran into. I'm of the opinion that in games like this that exploration and playing wide should be a reward for this. There is a level 20 cap mod that seems popular and I completely see why. This game is screaming to me for a better balanced level curve in it. Found myself on my second playthrough being at the level cap for more than half of the runs duration.","Aug 07, 2025",steam

"This game is what every modern RPG has to take notes from. The open ended game progression reminds me a lot of one of my favourite games, Fallout: New Vegas; you can choose what you want to do within each act outside of the main story and it will effect the rest of the game. Choices you make in Act 1 will change the NPCs in Acts 2 and 3 drastically, sometimes locking you out of content (which isn't bad for replay ability in an RPG). The setting and characters are interesting and for any fan of Dungeons and Dragons: Fifth Edition you'll enjoy a canonical experience of the franchise. If you're a real DnD nerd you'll recognise a lot of the name drop characters, and even meet a couple of them. The gameplay is really sold, with a lot of build choices within the Player's Handbook of 5e. Each with their own subclasses and the ability to bridge into multiple classes through multi-classing. You can create a custom ""Tav"" character just like you would create your own player character in 5e; all the options are there. I have nothing bad to say about this game. If you enjoy top down turn based RPG games, then this is the gold standard. The only disappointment is the controversy between the developer studio and publisher which lead them to indefinitely halt any DLC or expansions. So we can't expect any large content drops in the future, the base game is what it is; although it is already a fully fleshed out, enjoyable, large game you can pump hundreds of hours into. The developers plan to drop one new subclass for each of the classes as a Christmas-like gift to the players in January 2025, otherwise it's back to only bug fixes in patches.","Dec 04, 2024",steam

"4/10 to balance out the hype. Just like the last big gaming releases backed by social media marketing, the release of Baldur's Gate 3 has again pointed to the roots of marketing hypes and public relations: Propaganda. People become devotees up in arms against anyone who stands in the way of its Gloriousness, its Holyness, its Singularity. ""GOTY, GOTY, GOTY !!!"", consumed and forgotten one after the other. It's sad to see how the name of Baldur's Gate is used for an entirely different game that is also a part of all this frenetic and agitated hollowness that is shaping the current gaming industry as well as groupthink mentality. In this context, the actual game and its content have become pretty much irrelevant. BG3 is a professional industry-product. But it has almost nothing in common with the original 2 games. So what's the difference between BG 3 and the original two games which stayed in the memories of a whole generation of gamers? - BG 1+2: A personal journey with mysterious locations, epic tales, and legendary treasures to uncover. You start as a nobody that slowly gets involved in grander schemes while growing in power until your party fights the very gods that tried to exploit you. Pacing is great. - BG 3: A sequence of beautiful but arbitrary set pieces with random junk loot scattered around. The story starts with a bombastic climax as your lvl 1 party is already breaking out **** flying prison made out of tentacles. - BG 1+2: At its time an innovative and very fun combat system, ""real time with pause"", that translated the D&D rules to the computer medium and kept the narrative flowing while still providing a lot of tactical maneuverability because you could pause the action at any time. - BG 3: Common and generally slow turn-based system adapted from Divinity Original Sin where archdemons wait in line like orderly citizens. - BG 1+2: Charming and endearing characters with a wide range of personalities. Jon Irenicus as an iconic villain. - BG 3: In essence and in contrast to the supposed ""uniqueness"", the companions of BG3 act very trendy. The style is hip, the substance is square. A nod to mainstream fiction which is full of edgy antiheroes. - BG 1 + 2: Witty and nuanced high fantasy, reflections on the human condition and the thirst for power. - BG 3: Complete checklist of aggravatingly shallow identity politics, that fails to reflect that fiction can be more than just superficial representation without becoming reactionary. A disservice to truely progressive politics because of the heavy-handed moralizing involved. - BG 1+2: A gift by crazily talented people that wanted to share their passion. - BG 3: A fancy and stylized product based on a famous brand, made by industry experts. - BG 1+2: Ran on an average computer, just as Divinity Original Sin 2 which provided the engine for BG3. - BG3: Time to upgrade! Overpriced graphic cards have long enough been waiting for such an opportunity. After all these years, Baldur's Gate 3 doesn't change direction by building on its predecessors strengths, it rather escalates a sad trend by trying to assimilate the identity and brand of good old games while omitting most of the original's defining content.","Aug 5, 2023",metacritic
"The definition of innovative game design. BG3 perfectly incorporates and finds a balance between story where player's choices would slowly affect its surrounding, and gameplay where the class system adds tremendously deep gameplay and build options; and still manages to do an outstanding job on both, everything about this game is fascinating. What truly made me drop my jaws the most was the ""core"" mechanics of the game, and that is, choice. Nearly everything around you is interactive with your moves, spells or attacks. In addition, the dialogue and outcomes would also change according to the player's speech and choice of dialogue options, allowing the player to truly ""represent"" themselves as their in game characters. Where we truly follow our own nature to make decisions, make allies and enemies, build relations according to our own preferences, leaving the player with nearly infinitely many outcomes possible in the story. Probably one of my favorite games EVER, would want to get a surgery to remove my memory in order to experience this masterpiece again, 100/10 game y'all should give it a try.","Oct 03, 2025",steam

"Baldur’s Gate 3: A Masterpiece of RPGs (Astarion Is the Best Part) Baldur’s Gate 3 is everything I’ve ever wanted from an RPG and more. The game beautifully blends deep storytelling, complex characters, and tactical combat with the rich lore of the Dungeons & Dragons universe. Every decision you make has weight, and the freedom to shape your character and the world around you is truly remarkable. The environments are beautifully detailed, and the story keeps you on the edge of your seat with constant twists and turns. But let’s talk about Astarion. From his wit to his backstory, he’s easily one of the most captivating companions in the game. His charm, depth, and personality will have you hooked from the moment he joins your party. Would I Recommend It? Yes, without a doubt. Baldur’s Gate 3 is an incredible RPG that offers hours of content, meaningful decisions, and a truly engaging narrative. If you’re a fan of the genre, it’s a must-play. And if you’re looking for a character to fall in love with (metaphorically, of course), Astarion is a fantastic companion. His wit, charm, and complex story make him a highlight of the game. ⭐ 10/10 – A stunning RPG with memorable characters, and Astarion? He’s the cherry on top.","Dec 24, 2024",steam

Not everyone will enjoy playing like this for sure, but this option is a very good addition to the game. Though the game won GOTY, has a huge lore, an atmosphere that draws you in quickly, nice graphics and cutscenes, it still has some disadvantages. For example, getting same dice points is weird (again, you can mode the game as you want), but the worst thing I guess is that the game world is limited and isn't really big.

If you've seen parts of the story and like it then by all means get the game, but forcing you into the singular story is just not what I want in a DND game.","Nov 29, 2025",steam

"This is the first CRPG I've played where I had the impression that the game might notify law enforcement of choices made in game. There is something unsettling about it. There is very obviously a ""correct"" way to play the game, and an ""incorrect"" way. I did not care for the 120GB download. That assessment may be at least a partial reflection of the fact BG3 is significantly different from BG1 and 2, grognard discomfort with change, etc. But while there seems to be lots of ""choices and consequences"" I have the distinct impression there isn't actually much flexibility. In fairness, the 'chosen one' story kind of precludes that, but that kind of story always irks me. And it's blasted into the user's face immediately! BG1 had a much better approach - didn't really get a sense of the player character's role in the plot until later in the game (Of course, Arcanum has the best version of the 'chosen one' story imo). Also, very PO'd that there was no players' guide or equivalent in game. Owlcat did this well in their Pathfinder games, so there was no excuse for BG3 to exclude that information on character advancement, spells, etc. Even the OG BG1 and 2 let you look up those details. Going from 6 to 4 characters is a little lame but not a dealbreaker; however I do not care for the lack of alignment associated with characters. Perhaps that's how D&D plays now but it's stupid and lazy. Don't care for the moral relativism implied and it obviously causes problems with not-even-remotely-relativistic classes like paladins - yes, the paladin oath system is stupid. Lack of alignment obviously neuters squabbles between clerics and the pantheon too. Again, maybe thats a D&D thing now and not the studio's interpretation, in which case nu-D&D or whatever . BG3 is very strong in presentation though - the game runs smoothly, looks good (mostly), and to be honest it would probably be a great engine for modders to build their own campaigns on, but this ain't Neverwinter either. Pity. One area where it's presentation fails is the music and soundtrack. There is nothing dynamic about anything I've heard thus far, which is unfortunate as both BG1 and 2 had some very memorable themes. I haven't finished the game but also may or may not (at present, wandering around Moonrise Towers) - it just feels too locked up to me. I'll give a specific example here, and if i can actually do what I am attempting to do I'll edit this review accordingly to eat crow. I am attempting to play off the various players introduced around the Moonrise Towers off against each other, like a fantasy Yojimbo. I suspect I will be forced to ""choose a side"" regardless, at which point I may just give up on BG3. We'll see. (I was already quite annoyed by the game's direction rubbing my nose in my resolution of the first set piece. Thanks, I know what the player character decided to do, No, actually they were all useless to my purpose, but .) Disappointed grognard noises.","Jan 25, 2026",steam

"Fun as it is to be a contrarian, I can't help but agree with the universal praise this game is getting. It's been a long time since an RPG scratched all my itches and trust me, I've been looking. The funnest part with any RPG for me is experimenting with the story and choices you get, and that experimentation is (almost) always rewarded in BG3. It's the reason I've put an obscene amount of time in this game. Well, that and the characters. The companions especially feel more alive than in most RPGs out there. (Shown by how passionately some people love or hate them.) But there are also plenty of smaller characters that are just as interesting.

"A generational banger. I was pretty skeptical at first since turn-based games never really grabbed me. The only one that ever pulled me in before this was Wakfu, which I actually really enjoyed for a while. But Baldur’s Gate 3? It hit different. Once it got its hooks in, it never let go. The combat is super fun once you get into it, and the freedom you have is just wild. You can go anywhere, do anything, and the game actually reacts to it. The story is packed with memorable moments and epic boss fights, made even better by the amazing music. The origin characters are done so well. You grow close to them, and you can totally betray them if you want. That kind of freedom is rare. The world feels alive, like you're really paving your own path instead of just following a set story. It actually feels like a proper Dungeons and Dragons campaign, rules and all. And as good as it is solo, it gets even better when played with friends. The chaos, the laughs, the unexpected decisions with your party add a whole new layer to the experience. But don’t worry. If turn-based stuff isn’t your thing, just play it on easy and enjoy the ride. Learn the basics, and you’ll be surprised how natural it starts to feel. The characters, the dialogue, the music... it’s all superbly done. One of the best games I’ve played in years.","Aug 09, 2025",steam

"id like to start with saying i do adore this game and plan to play many more runs if i can, and all the issues ive listed have been fixable or able to be brute forced with trial and erorr- and ultimately that struggle was worth it to me. 1. It's not a very intuitive game At the beginning of my play through, i spent maybe 6-7 hours on different runs because I was stuck and not sure how to continue. In the end I had to look up what to do next. I had no clue where some of the companions were, and by the time I looked it up, I had slept several days and was locked out of them, and had to ultimately restart. At the Ancient Forge, I had no clue how to figure out the lava elemental boss fight. There's a mechanic that was unexplained that you had to shoot the lever to bring down its defenses. 2. This game is not for you if you're bad at video games I will admit this is a skill issue on my part but I still think its important for people to know. It is easily fixable with some mods, which there is a lovely mod system included with the game. I absolutely couldn't pass, on easy, without downloading a mod to have more party members. 3. Very unstable I have a higher end computer, and even I had to turn my graphics and FPS down low + aim a fan at my tower to blast it with cold air. Even with all of this, the game still crashes every 30 minutes. Cannot for the life of me figure whats wrong. 4. Some things are just not done well Some mechanics are broken, or too hard to do the intended way. At the Temple of Shar, the invisible step path was nearly impossible to do the intended way- looking at the tile and moving the path that way. The only easy reliable way to get across as needed is either flying, teleporting, or another trick where you use the turn based system which can visibly show the change in elevation. I also find I end up brute forcing locks before even figuring out there was a way to do it without lockpicking. But maybe thats just because I have Astarion on my team.","Sep 21, 2025",steam

The negatives of this game are few in my opinion, the size of the game itself is massive, what it demands of your machine graphically and processing power is also a con. What you get in exchange of those very justifiable negatives is a gargantuan story that contains a seemingly limitless amount of permutations, pathways and choices with consequences. You get characters with charm, emotion, struggles and convictions that make you want to get involved with them either to stop them or to help them. Finally, you get an ending, one that resulted in the culmination of your choices, you don't have to wait for another game to get that, you don't have to buy any dlc to achieve it, simply play through the game and you'll get to the end and you'll also get a small epilogue, putting a bow on it all.

"Saving the World… After I Finish My 70 Naps Baldur's Gate 3 isn't merely a great role-playing game; it is a structural anomaly. It is, in effect, a proof-of-concept that demonstrates what happens when a major budget is deployed not in pursuit of the live-service treadmill, but in absolute service to player agency. Larian Studios took the chaotic, magnificent spirit of Dungeons & Dragons and rendered it with systemic integrity, solving the decades-old issue of the illusion of choice that plagues the modern RPG genre. The triumph here is not its narrative, though it’s often compelling, but its terrifying mechanical consistency. The Freedom of Choice One of the reasons why Baldur's Gate 3 is successful is its refusal to treat player choice as a mere series of dialogue prompts. Where other titles offer a tightly curated set of branching paths, Larian delivered a simulated reality governed by D&D 5E's core rules. If a character is meant to be unreachable, they are not protected by an invisible wall; they are simply separated by geometry and elevation, obstacles that can be overcome with a simple Misty Step, an improvised jump, or a strategically placed oil barrel. This systemic fidelity grants players the genuine, unsettling freedom to break the game's intended path, and the underlying code is trusted to calculate the consequence. This is the difference between performative agency (AKA when dialogue leads to the same outcome) and true consequence. This approach generates those singular, emergent moments (like the infamous scene involving Halsin, or the bizarre solutions to dungeon puzzles) that are unique to the player’s session, proving that the digital medium can finally emulate the chaotic collaboration of a tabletop campaign. It sets the standard for interactive design by demonstrating that the designer's job is not to dictate the story, but merely to construct the responsive simulation. The art direction shifts between the grimy, oppressive environments of the Goblin Camp and the breathtaking, bioluminescent splendor of the Underdark, establishing a clear mood for every narrative beat. Crucially, the camera's shift from the isometric viewpoint to the tight, cinematic focus during dialogue acts as a crucial validation mechanism. It signals to the player that their decisions are being treated with the same industrial-scale seriousness as a major pre-scripted cutscene. With two million words of recorded dialogue, the quality is often exceptional—particularly the companion performances, which carry the majority of the game’s emotional load. In a game designed to let you talk, sneak, or murder your way out of every encounter, the quality of the dialogue delivery must be consistent to maintain the player’s immersion in the responsive simulation. The orchestral score, while expertly crafted, serves primarily as an effective, atmospheric support layer, underscoring the player’s action without dominating the soundscape. However, such radical ambition inevitably encounters the untenable volume required to sustain it. While Act I and Act II thrive on a tight, interconnected geography, Act III marks where the simulation’s sheer weight begins to crush the narrative's structure. The urgency of the main plot is utterly contradicted by the administrative load of the finale. The game implicitly requires players to wade through thirty or more hours of companion resolutions, murder mysteries, and urban political intrigue to cash in the emotional and narrative debt accumulated over the previous two acts. Crucially, many vital character moments are tied to the Long Rest mechanic, forcing the player, in a moment of narrative crisis, to repeatedly retreat to camp just to ensure companions receive their overdue emotional cutscenes. In my playthough, this resulted in making the plot's climax feel less like a roaring crescendo and more like an abrupt conclusion following an exhaustive slog through content administration. But, everyone's playthrough is different. This brings us to the uncomfortable truth and that is Baldur's Gate 3 is a profound exception. Larian Studios is privately owned meaning they are allowed the luxury ""freedom"". A six-year development cycle, an eventual team size of 450, and the ability to fund the game through the success of their previous independent IPs and a long, stable Early Access period is what made Baldur's Gate 3 the game it is today. A game which sold a complete, single-player experience with zero monetisation hooks, simply does not fit the modern spreadsheet. The game’s creation required producing over two million words of voice-acted dialogue and animating hundreds of unique cinematic scenes designed for outcomes only a fraction of players will ever see. For your typical AAA studio, this is not something they would do - they operate on the principle of the Minimum Viable Product, maximising monetisation on predictable, repeatable structural foundations. In the end, Baldur's Gate 3 is an astonishing work of art—a towering monument to the possibilities of player agency. Its flaws are the scars of its own radical ambition, the inevitable trade-off when simulation dares to surpass scripted narrative. It is a masterpiece, not because it is perfect, but because it exposed how far the industry had drifted from simply making great games for the sake of making great games.","Oct 06, 2025",steam
"Great story, in depth characters/building. It's not easy to jump into, which is one reason it's not a 10. The amount of different play styles that can be had is immense. Exploring is rewarding. The characters side stories and surprisingly meaningful. I like the linear feel with since it allows the devs to tailor the atmosphere to what's going on in the story. Open world games struggle with this and everything just blends in and the story just revolves around big areas that end up looking and feeling the same. Decision making is HUGE. Very few games pull this off. Pc to ps5 is amazing. Overall I'm happy and can talk forever.","Sep 3, 2023",metacritic
"I bought me and my buddy this game due to the outrageously good reviews, and a bit of nostalgia since I owned the original Baldur's gate.

The narrative is intricate and engaging, with numerous twists that keep you on the edge of your seat. The characters are well-developed, each with their own backstories and motivations. Interacting with them feels natural and meaningful, showcasing excellent writing and design. Baldur's Gate 3 is a superb medium for bringing the Dungeons & Dragons experience to a broader audience.

The game integrates D&D mechanics seamlessly, making it accessible to both veterans and newcomers. In summary, Baldur's Gate 3 is a masterpiece that blends a captivating story, well-defined characters, and the spirit of D&D into an unforgettable gaming experience.

"I’ve played Baldur’s Gate 3 through at least six full times—ranging from noble good-aligned heroes to full-on villainous Dark Urge runs, and everything in between. Custom characters, origin characters, chaotic choices, and methodical planning—I’ve done it all. And I can confidently say this: Baldur’s Gate 3 is one of the best games I’ve ever played. Every playthrough feels fresh. The amount of reactivity and consequence in the game world is staggering. Characters remember what you’ve done. Entire story arcs twist and transform depending on your choices—not just major ones, but even how you handle small conversations or side quests. You don’t just play a character in this game—you are that character, shaped by your every word and action. The writing is top-tier. Voice acting, storytelling, and emotional depth rival anything you’d find in a big-budget HBO series. The companions are unforgettable, and by the end of each run, you feel genuinely attached to them—whether you love them, hate them, or love to hate them. Gameplay-wise, the turn-based combat is a perfect translation of D&D 5e. It’s tactical, challenging, and highly rewarding. There’s room for creative problem-solving in and out of combat, whether you’re exploding barrels, charming enemies, or leaping across rooftops to gain an edge. Baldur’s Gate 3 isn’t just a great CRPG—it’s a generational game. A high watermark for storytelling, player agency, and replayability. If you’re even remotely a fan of roleplaying games, this is a must-play. Final Verdict: 10/10. An all-time great. I’ll be coming back to this for years.","Jun 19, 2025",steam
"It's no exaggeration to say this is one of the greatest games of all time. This comment box would not do it justice. Gameplay, voice acting, exploration, story, soundtrack, all top of the line. It does have that CRPG jank, with bugs and glitches, but it can all easily be overlooked. The last act of the game also shows some signs of it being rushed/unfinished, which is a shame, but it's really such a minor downside given this game sheer scale. Definitely give this game a chance.","Feb 15, 2024",metacritic
"I've finished the game and I'm still thinking about it. I already know that this game will leave me with feeling of nostalgia for decades, same as older BG games did. Yes, there are few bugs, yes, you can feel quality difference between ACT I and rest of the game. But so what, the settings, the log, fascinating characters, mechanics allowing to do creative things, all of it evens out all other bumps. For me it's 10/10!","Sep 8, 2023",metacritic

"Im going to be the jerk who does not recommend this game I guess. You can see by my hours played that I enjoyed the game up until my honor mode run attempt. Epic run, will never repeat it again.... and a game ending bug ruining it for me. Completed act 2 and went into Wyrm's Lookout Camp but could not advance from there. The raid never happened and I could not exit the camp without fast traveling. When fast traveling back to Act 2, everything was reset. The map was unexplored, all the mobs that were killed prior were alive again, and all kinds of funky stuff was happening. When I tried to long rest in Act two, 3 Naked Gale Mirror Images spawned, all naked but without private parts. Just nubs. I finally lost the honor mode run when I attempted to walk back to Act 1 in order to maybe reset it. Trust me when I say, I tried everything I could to get this to advance to no avail. I sunk in countless hours, and honestly.... I never want to play again. I would like a refund please and would advise others to wait for the remastered edition in 5-10 years.","Jul 24, 2025",steam

"Can “woke” elements ruin a game? Yes — absolutely. Nearly every character I’ve encountered feels like either a “gayboy” or a “girlboss.” Don’t get me wrong: Larian nailed the mechanics, depth, and freedom of choice. On that front, it’s brilliant. The problem is that modern D&D, and by extension this adaptation, is weighed down by too much cultural baggage. Most of the characters so far are unlikable, and honestly? I’ve killed most of them out of sheer spite. D&D used to feel like a hyper-magical version of LOTR; now it’s more like a group of baristas and activists in cosplay, stripped of any real sense of masculinity or gravitas.","Sep 21, 2025",steam
"QoL is absolutely awful: - switching between keyboard & gamepad is slow and makes trades clear - alt+tab puts you in keyboard mode, meaning you cannot quickly tab out while conducting a trade in gamepad mode, because it will lose your progress - hovering over items in inventory makes descriptions appear after ~half a second, making it very very laborious to find items in inventory and trade window - changing quantity of coins on gamepad is very slow, ticking one coin at a time and never accelerating - typing in quantities soft locks steam deck unrecoverably I strongly suspect that they developed this game for keyboard and mouse and never really tried to make gamepad good. They would have found these issues in the first 5 hours of play testing. It's been out for (checks watch) 2.5 years and these are unresolved. The rest of the game seems fantastic. I wish that these egregious issues were not standing in my way.","Jan 08, 2026",steam

Great story, characters and lots of choices that actually matter. Combat system is good aswell, only part some ppl might miss is a Realtime with pause mode some other RPGs have, but I like Turnbased more since its less chaotic. Only critique is character pathing.

The game itself is very good, it has so many options to approach something and it does not tell you that the option is possible. You have to find out yourself. The biggest issue that I found with it is, that sometimes your companions get stuck in a part of the map and you have to manually move them to the area. Happened to me 4 times during 4 differnt battles. Review will be updated later on 9.5/10","Dec 30, 2024",steam

"Well, there is much that can be said about Balder's Gate 3, and much of it has already been said. I'll try and give my perspective as to why I find this game so enjoyable, and hopefully it will not just be a regurgitation of what you've already heard. How it is to play At its core, Balder's Gate 3 is a video game. I know.... shocking revelation. But what I mean is that you get to actually play this game - very few events in this game will happen unless you specifically do something. This is not a game you can simply just watch happen. You get to decide what happens - you are essentially the director of the gameplay. It's not a game where you can just spam the X or A button to win. You have to actually play it as if it were a machine you are operating. See, this is something that I feel like a lot of modern video games are doing a terrible job at - there are many games out there where you could get the experience they offer just by watching someone else play them or just by watching their cutscenes. The gameplay is so minute that it is more or less a means to end to tell a story. Balder's Gate 3 is not like that. In the same way that I can replay Resident Evil 4 multiple times, Balder's Gate 3 offers the same kind of gameplay experience. There is so much variety, and it largely depends on what, you, the player choose to do. What class you pick, how you choose to buff yourself with armor/weapons, what party make-up you choose, what subclasses you pick - the granularity is deep. There is simply too many options available to you, and it's a good thing. You don't have to be a Monk and just punch your way through every conflict. You can be a Bard and buff Lae'zel and have her smack things out of your way. You can be a Wizard and just cast Hypnotic Pattern and make the enemies unable to even attack. You can be a Ranger and relive your days as a Skyrim stealth archer. Speaking of Skyrim, I never understood the love for Bethesda games as they all pretty much offer the same thing: a good template for a video game, but absent of an actual video game - they leave that up to the modding community. Playing Skyrim without mods is like driving 5 mph on a highway. BG3 without mods is like you're going on a roadtrip - you are perfectly comfortable going at the pace you are. And while mods help the gameplay (mostly QoL stuff), I can't say the the vanilla BG3 experience was bad. Hell, most of that 1000 hour playtime I've racked up is me just fooling around in the vanilla game. There's just so much gamey goodness to it that I didn't really feel the need for mods. It reminds me a lot Mass Effect 1, which isn't surprising as BioWare created the first two Balder's Gate games. It's nice that Larian was able to take the experience the previous BG games offered and modernize it. Mass Effect 1 was my go to action RPG experience as I never could get into the original BG games. I used to really like Mass Effect 1 more so than its sequels. But now? BG3 scratches the same itch and more. It feels good to win in fights - especially if you just barely make it. I know turn-based combat turns off a lot of people, but I would argue BG3 does it right. And it's not even a new system. Final Fantasy X essentially uses the same battle system: turn order displayed, you can delay your opponents from attacking, you can debuff and buff your enemies/allies to turn the turn-order to your advantage and so on. It feels like I am bringing up a lot of different games to compare BG3 to, so how about another: Metal Gear Solid. Sneaking is actually a really useful aspect of combat. You can see your enemies' cones of vision while sneaking, so you can better set your party up to initiate combat at an advantage. It does remind me of playing the original MGS and just watching the radar to make sure I wasn't gonna stumble into a guard's sight. And much like how in MGS3 where you could throw food or animals at guards to distract/kill them, you can do similar actions or spells in BG3 that achieve the same effect. BG3 is a combination of many different games, and I would say: it took all their good parts and exacerbated them. I am struggling to come up with something about this game that holds it back. There's some minor gameplay grudges (like not being able to set up a default hotbar organization for future playthroughs, or not being able to edit the appearances of Origin characters, or how Act 3 is over-loaded with a bit too much content for players to do and not get exhausted - could be a good thing I guess), but I have had more fun playing this game in the past year or so than most other games. And I say all this without even addressing the story - much has been said about the performances of this game, so I won't go into too much detail, but I will say this: this game manages to pull off what the Mass Effect trilogy epicly failed to do: deliver a satisfying conclusion to a player-choice-driven gameplay experience that is all tied up in a nice bow. And it did it with just one game. That's impressive. While we could nitpick certain characters for not being well-developed or used appropriately (Wyll, Halsin, Minsc), all-in-all, what is here is satisfying. I recommend this game if you find yourself pining for a true video game experience that isn't just cutscene spam or just press to X to win. If you like making choices and having them matter, this is a game you need to play. If you like customizing your experience however you want, this is the game to play. If you have already played this game to death and are looking for more, check out what the modding community has on the table as there is so much there (Alfira Joins the Party, New races. New subclasses, New weapons/spells, etc.)","Dec 18, 2024",steam

Most of the characters I've met and interacted with feel real and lovable. Your party set up can be different time and time again, so the combat will never get stale. On top of that, you can change your character time and time again. With Withers, you can change you class, with the magic mirror (under some limitations) you can change your appearance.

Few titles manage to blend graphics, dialogue, and deep companion relationships with such flawless precision. Every choice feels meaningful. Every conversation carries weight. The level of detail in the world design, from the smallest piece of dialogue to the grandest cinematic moment, is nothing short of extraordinary. The companions aren’t just party members; they feel alive, with real personalities, evolving arcs, and emotional depth. The voice acting is phenomenal, the writing rivals high-end fantasy novels, and the graphics bring the Forgotten Realms to life in breathtaking detail. Even after hundreds of hours, I’m still discovering new interactions and storylines I missed before. That’s how rich and layered this game is.

Pretty good but the AI can be the most frustrating thing at times. Not sure if it will be believed unless I tell the full story so here it goes. There's a quest where you have to protect two people in a cave from a bunch of monsters coming in that can very easily kill them. The problem is you have to jump over a gap to get to them from where I found them. The problem is that that for some reason only two or three people were allowed to be on the side of the gap closest to said NPCs I had to protect and the last party member who was meant for melee would constantly jump back over the gap and thus screw up the whole strategy. I unironically spent a half hour trying to wrangle this very special individual before I gave up due to the rising blood pressure putting me at risk of a heart attack. 10/10 would get a coronary again.,"Jan 02, 2025",steam

"One of my top three games I've ever played, this is coming from someone that has never touched another game in this genre previously and was initially skeptical of trying it during it's initial hype. At it's core it's a top down turn based roleplay RPG, containing a majority of the classes from Dungeons & Dragons, you get to make a highly personalized character with the myriad of presented customization options, of which you can get even more with the plenty of community made mods. Without getting into any spoilers, the story and world building are really good, you meet many great characters throughout your playthrough, for which you are giving the choice to add them into your party. Every character has interesting and seperately unique personalities, they all have different interpersonal relationships between eachother and at times butt heads with one another. Your choices throughout your playtrough influence the character development of your companions, depending on what you choose to do they can end up being a whole different person at the end of the story. Since your choices influence the development of the story, Baldur's Gate 3 has immense replayability, containing many different endings and a lot of things scattered throughout the map, which you will probably miss during your first playthrough. Even if you are thorough with your exploration, there are still things you can easily miss, only to discover them during your second or third time playing. I wholeheartedly recommend playing this game, if you have any semblance of taste in video games, I guarantee you will not regret spending a single cent of the money you put down on this game.","Aug 10, 2025",steam
"Ну, слава у игры громче, чем сами возможности. Да, здесь сюжет ветвится на много линий. По разному можно поступать. Хорошо проработаны напарники (комедийные напарники Джахейра и Минск - отличные камео к прошлым частям). Бои сбалансированы. Но... Сюжет - одна сплошная рельса. - Хоть что делай, но всё равно придётся сражаться (зачем тогда броски кубика перед финальной битвой?). - И шипастая игрушка (астральная призма) нагло прыграет в руки, когда отказываешь брать Шадоухарт в отряд (логичнее наоборот: все напарники остаются с ней, так как у неё защита). - и другие случаи. Полно явных решений, которых почему-то в игре нет. Т.е. я хочу сказать, что Ларианцы не дотянули до японских РПГ (да и старых западных), когда плохая концовка возникает из-за того, что в начале выбрал не ту девочку. У них даже просто экранов смерти от плохого решения очень мало. Весь контент можно найти за 2 прохождения (если не брать моды на снятие размеров команды - с ними за 1, но с короткими сохранениями-загрузками). Учитывая, что игра большая - это и так долго, но можно было сделать больше ограничений, чтобы требовались разные стили игры, а не разные члены команды. Зато куда трудней получить все разговоры компаньонов и все активности в лагере. Тут всё какое-то случайное. Обидно. Ещё из-за кучи выборов полно багов, когда персонажи в заданиях говорят по ветке-1, хотя ты выбрал ветку-3.","Jun 10, 2024",metacritic

"After spending ALL that money on a digital download, believe me if I say that I would have REALLY loved to say that this game is awesome. But, no: it's definitely OVERRATED. Any game of the Dragon Age series does it better. Mind you: I'm playing it on a 2nd hand old-model SteamDeck and I'm a new player. The UI is confusing, the dialogues are meh! and this sci-fi Chtulu reference just doesn't compute. The plot is weak and Astarion might be sassy and funny but he's basically a beggar/junkie that begs for players' blood. Seductive at first, annoying and repetitive after some time. Quests are incredibly boring and the map is a pain to navigate. THE TURN-BASED COMBAT SYSTEM IS SOOO EXHAUSTING!!! Today, I spent 1 hour and 30 minutes (real-time!) fighting domb goblins that had been alerted by a delirious priestess that almost annihilated me. I would have recommended the game, if it would have been at a 15-25 price point. Characters' eyes look empty and they avoid eye-contact when they are talking to the player!!! Major Cons: - any body of water is a problem because swimming and diving don't exist, yikes, - camera angles are an issue, - the player is VERY restricted in terms of movement range! you can't run, jump, go in stealth as you please, you have to navigate menus, Plus points: - character customisation options, - the soundtrack - the level of minute detail - at times - landscapes (minus the sci-fi theme) UPDATE: ok, after FINALLY finding Karlach and adopting a dog :) things improved a little bit. I'm now at level 4. I'm super happy about the class choice, my druid can talk to animals and that helps a lot, in my experience. I understand that to play this game, you basically have to explore a lot and really think about what you're doing and why. Hopefully, the worst is behind me. Still, the fight against the hyenas boss was tiresome and lasted over 1 hour. At some point I had Karlach throw HER BOOTS at the boss! LOL SECOND UPDATE: I have now slooowly learned to appreciate the game for what it is, but it's a really really cumbersome gaming experience. Things just don't flow. There is no smoothness and the story does not convince me.","Sep 13, 2025",steam

"It's ok. It's quite a lot overhyped for what it is, most praising it for things that should be the standard but have been allowed NOT to be the standard. RPG mechanic-wise it is probably one of the best games of it's genre of the recent years. RP-wise, you are still quite heavily railroaded, and the further into the game You go the worse it gets. Most of the characters are also 'ok', and only 'ok'. It's still a far cry from the writing of old RPG games, and modern writers (including BG3 ones) only in theory know what the word 'subtlety' or 'nuance' means. Also related: For people that think that romance paths are well written and 'not bad' in this game, go out into the real world sometimes, talk with an actual human being. Just to have some kind of comparison of how natural human interactions and relationships actually work. Again - subtlety, patience, build-up are words modern writers seemed to only see written down, but never understood the meaning of. The stat roll mechanics that the majority of the game is built upon loses any meaning almost immediately, since the game is just built for save-scumming. Not in a way that just allows it but in a way that if You don't then You can just miss on content, since bad rolls do not push You into an original and unique path, as much as they can just lock You out of things. I purchased the game after it was 'finished' and after it left EA, and tbh I feel scammed when it comes to that. Cause the game was blatantly NOT finished at the time, and it still doesn't seem to be. It's PLAYABLE, not FINISHED. Most might be happy that the game still gets support and patches and content updates - I am not. What I was expecting is the CONTENT of the game is finalized. That when I finally choose to play it, that this is it. It was not. Parts of the game that I played has been changed time and time again, the mechanics, the design was changed and tweaked. That's not maintenance, that's not patching the game to work as intended, it's not debugging. That's DEVELOPMENT. Something that I was led to believe was finalized at the time of the purchase, and yet most (although not all) customers are fine with just because they're used to being treated worse, and because the dev has put himself as the opposition to the trash that happens on the market. It is still a product though - it's better than AVERAGE, it's LESS of a false marketing than usual. It still WAS false marketing to release it as a finished product. And Yeah, my saves after quitting it for a longer time until they get the patches further HAVE broken because of the patches. Can't wait for the game to be FINISHED and stop getting CHANGED so I can start a new playthrough of a non-Early Access build. 8/10. In a world of blind, the one-eyed is the king.","Jan 31, 2025",steam

"This game is one of the best games I have ever played. The attention to detail is remarkable. Countless ways have been considered to solve—or worsen—a situation. Diplomacy, intrigue, romances, battles, and treacherous pushes off a cliff. Hero of the day or ruler of the world. Everything is possible, making *Baldur’s Gate 3* one of the few games that not only gives you the feeling of influencing the course of the story but actually allows you to fundamentally change it. The atmosphere is breathtaking at times, and the soundtrack is fantastic. I constantly pull out my lute or flute in battles and play a tune for my companions—and if I don’t, I place a music box at their feet instead. All in all, it’s safe to say that one playthrough will turn into many, and I highly recommend everyone to do the same!","Feb 19, 2025",steam
"Definitely a good game. You won't regret getting it. I think it deserves more details from me I realised as I looked at my review. The main thing about this game is the sheer amount of ways you can go about solving a quest or handling an area of mobs you want to kill. No encounter goes the same way when you reload or play with another character. The replayability is amazing, it is what makes it so worth while buying and playing.The dialogue has so many options you may never see unless you picked a specific set of responses which one may never do even on a 5th replay. Truly a masterpiece. Larian hit this out of the ballpark.","May 03, 2025",steam

"Reviewing before I finish this game, although I doubt anything will change in regards to my feelings for this game. I'll try to not repeat anything that's already been said about BG3, although that will be difficult. This is truly Game of the Year material, and it deserved every single award it has garnered since it's release. It is a role-players heaven, even moreso if you're a fan of DnD. The freedom to approach almost any situation in any way you want is a breath of fresh air: Want to talk a boss into offing themselves? Sure, roll for deception. Want to pickpocket an item from an NPC and then tell them to give it to you only to realise you've stolen it from them and have them fight you? Sure. Want to stuff a backpack full of explosives, throw it on the ground before the fight and then shoot it at the start to literally obliterate everyone in the vicinity? Go ahead. The world, although not a true open world since moving between regions happens on a linear path, is so rich and filled with genuinely interesting stuff. No mind numingly boring fetch quests, no arbitrary collectables that only serve to pad the game, no nothin. Someone can play the entire game and realise they've missed like a dozen quests or a dozen locations cause they just did not notice them. The combat feels rewarding, especially when you get to higher levels and can execute some amazing strategies. It's also very freeing being able to approach combat in any way you want, through using the environment, to using dialogue, through combining different skills and items. There hasn't been a single encounter where I felt frustrated, instead, if I got my ass handed to me, I just thought of new ways to approach the encounter, which the game encourages you to do by giving you hints in the form of books, notes, dialogue etc. There are some less than stelar things like the presence of some bugs or the fact that some companions' quests and general character are less interesting than others, but I digress, these aren't such big issues at the end of the day. This game truly feels like a game adaptation of very captivating DnD campaign. And even if you haven't even played DnD before, this game is one of the most enjoyable TBRPGs out there, hell, it's one of the best RPGs out there period. The depth of the choices and their consequences really reminds me of New Vegas, which also makes me sad that these types of fleshed out games are so few and far between. The sheer amount of dialogue lines this game has is astonishing, and the way the NPCs react to your party's deeds and your own choices is very interesting. The game is also -as of writing this review- 100% feature complete. The final update just released and delivered what some games would charge 20 and 30 euros for, completely for free. This game has no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ microtransactions, no overpriced DLC, no season passes, nothing. You pay 60 euros and you get around 80-100 hours of your first playthrough, plus endless potential for replayability and co-oop of up to 4 players! These are the types of developers people should support, people that care about crafting good experiences, people that value the player's time and money. Hats off Larian, you beautiful bastards. It'll be ages before we get an RPG quite like BG3.","Apr 29, 2025",steam

"This game is honestly incredible. I wasn’t sure what to expect going in, but it blew me away. The story is super engaging, and the choices you make actually matter—like, characters will react differently depending on what you say or do, and it can totally change the way things play out. The combat is turn-based, which I wasn’t used to at first, but it grew on me fast. It’s really strategic and fun once you get the hang of it. There’s also a ton of freedom in how you approach situations—sneaking, talking your way out, going full chaos, whatever fits your playstyle. The companions are amazing. Each one has their own backstory, personality, and they feel like real people. I ended up caring about all of them, even the ones I didn’t think I’d like at first. Visually, the game looks great too. The environments are beautiful, the character animations during cutscenes are top-notch, and the voice acting is some of the best I’ve heard in any RPG. If you like D&D, story-rich RPGs, or just games that give you a lot of freedom, definitely give this one a shot. Easily one of the best games I’ve played in a long time.","Jun 16, 2025",steam

"I loved this game. There is so much game here I can't even begin to play every route and there are so many hidden secrets it's insane. There's so many little secret interactions so truly no two playthroughs will ever be the same. The companions are easily the strongest part, I ended up caring way too much about the main six companions. I also love D&D so the combat and lore was very fun to me. The music is good, of course. Now some complaints. While the story overall is very good, some story elements aren't the best. Act 1 clearly got more love than Act 3, making some things fall flat, but there is literally so much game here I understand why it didn't get as much attention near the end, especially due to time constraints. Some parts of the story had rewrites and you can tell they aren't as strong. They game is also incredibly buggy, which I honestly just expect from AAA games at this point, but my game was so bugged that literally every playthrough is just different due to different bugs. Characters sometimes didn't express story stuff to be that led to confusing but funny scenarios, for example My PC bluescreened at least twice during my playthrough, and crashed many more. My PC was built in 2022 with all the latest tech available at the time, it is not a baby, it really shouldn't be having issues so I can only blame the game. Also the final battle was the most bugged thing ever which really killed the immersion. Despite those few complaints, I really do love this game. I do understand some of the bugs, like there are so many branching story options and voice lines recorded for extremely niche scenarios that are so fun to find. Also most of the bugs were more funny than the frustrating for the most part. If I could wipe it from my brain to play blindly over again I would. Definitely one of my favorite games out there.","Oct 03, 2025",steam

Sure the game is pretty, but when every single dialogue option goes to an in game cutscene even for npcs that say one line and don't have any interactions then it becomes overindulgent. The UI is absolutely terrible. It fights with you every step of the way and will have you constantly save scumming. The actual gameplay is not fun. The max lvl in the game is 12 so just as your build was starting to feel good boom game ends. Majority of the game is spent at low levels DnD which I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.","Aug 11, 2023",metacritic

"This game just isn't for me. Even with all the praise its gotten and all of the good things I've heard from other people, it just completely loses me before even finishing act 1. The combat, which takes up a majority of the game, is a tedious slog as it seems every fight is insanely stacked against you. There is no joy I can derive from engaging with the same fight over and over again as I pray to have the RNG work in my favor so I can progress. Having recently beaten KOTOR (a month or two before this review), which has all of the same problems as Baldur's Gate 3, seems remarkably quick compared to the huge amount of tedium that exists in this game. I would truly not recommend this to anyone who has any sort of life worth living","Feb 05, 2025",steam

"This game is unforgiving if you are impatient, don't plan ahead, don't properly rest between combat engagements, and don't learn your characters' capabilities. It's easy to be become underleveled if you don't explore enough. It's also easy to explore too much and land somewhere you're not supposed to be yet. But there's always a way to escape, quicksave is your friend, and the game is so fun. It has a lot of that XCom ""just one more thing"" vibe that accidentally keeps you playing until 2am on a work night.","Sep 24, 2023",ign

"I can confidently say that Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the best RPGs ever made. Larian Studios has delivered a game that blends epic storytelling, deep gameplay, and unmatched freedom. The writing is phenomenal, with choices that truly matter and unforgettable characters like Astarion and Shadowheart, whose personalities and backstories draw you in completely. The turn-based combat is tactical and rewarding, but what truly sets the game apart is its creativity—solving problems with diplomacy, stealth, or even throwing someone off a cliff is entirely up to you. Add stunning visuals, a meticulously crafted world, and a gorgeous soundtrack, and you have a fully immersive experience that redefines what RPGs can achieve. With incredible replayability thanks to branching storylines and countless approaches to situations, Baldur's Gate 3 is the new gold standard for the genre and an absolute must-play.","Dec 23, 2024",steam
"BG3 is a very challenging game to review... It has near universal acclaim and therefore feels untouchable; it sucks you in and fits an old D&D player like a glove. It's amazing to really push the adapted 5e ruleset to its limits and imagine all your worst minmaxxed fears, but this is sadly also where it starts breaking down. There are a few running bugs that occur often unless you have 3rd party assistance - I had to cap the fps to 60 or risk the game crashing every 5 minutes (Thanks Reddit) and even so, crashes abound. Sneak, stealth and surprise are all bugged and non-intuitive - they often require you to bypass the turnbased nature of the game to realise, which makes them unusable in most instances. Multiclassing often bugs base class features or requires you to class in a certain order for them to work, (Thanks again Reddit.) And in one instance, a multiclass rogue/ranger had none of its base class features proc, ever. (Thanks to posters on Larian's own forums for running a 2 year long thread pointing this one out.) All in all though, the average player or non-D&D player will quite likely never encounter most of these and have a blast. The story gets a 10/10 for inventiveness and last minute second guessing; but a 1/10 for replayability due to relying heavily on surprise - so just roll 4 Fighters into a party, minmax them for combat and smash your way through - who needs all that fancy dialog afterall. If I could give a 50/100, I would, but Steam needs a Yay or Nay - all in all, I still enjoyed the hell out of it, even though it often frustrated me beyond words, so I'll mark it a yes. Please just make more adventures. Don't need a BG4, just fix the basic bugs in the engine and roll out more stories - CoS, ToA, DtA will all be amazing to experience in this setting and all start in Baldurs Gate, so no need to recreate it. D&D is a system with which to explore worlds, you have the system, now bring the worlds or it all fails","Nov 06, 2025",steam

"What is there to say about Baldur's Gate 3 that hasn't already been said? The closest representation of Dungeons and Dragons that has ever been accomplished in video game format. Larian perfected the turn-based top-down, immersive, story-based RPG genre with Divinity: Original Sin 2 which is MY personal favorite game of all time. In my opinion Baldur's Gate 3 does not capture the magic that Divinity has, but manages to capture the magic of D&D quite well.","Jul 09, 2025",steam

"I'm in the middle of my second playthrough and still thinking of things to do for another. There's so much replayability and unique choices, even if you mess around by stealing things in stealth or killing some characters. This is a fine playthrough whether you're solo, with friends, custom characters, or the ones in the story. Just try to go in as blind as possible, live by your choices, and have fun.","Nov 30, 2025",steam
"Baldur’s Gate 3 is a triumph of storytelling, character depth, and gameplay mechanics that manages to appeal even to those who may not typically enjoy top-down strategy or tactical games. As someone who doesn't usually gravitate toward the genre, my love for Dungeons & Dragons tipped the scales, and I'm thrilled it did. From the moment you dive into the world, the game feels alive, rich with lore, and dripping with choices that matter. The narrative depth is staggering, allowing for endless possibilities based on player decisions. The voice acting, dialogue, and character interactions breathe life into every encounter, making you feel like you're living through a tabletop campaign with all the dramatic flair and humor you’d expect. The gameplay might initially feel daunting for newcomers to tactical combat or D&D-inspired systems. However, the combat system is intuitive, with plenty of flexibility for creativity. Whether you're leaping across the battlefield, shoving enemies into environmental hazards, or casting spells with devastating or hilarious effects, the game encourages you to think outside the box. Visually, Baldur’s Gate 3 is stunning. The environments are crafted with incredible detail, and the character models are expressive, ensuring that the emotional weight of your decisions lands effectively. Combined with the stirring soundtrack, the game becomes an immersive experience that’s hard to put down. What sets this game apart for someone like me is how faithfully it captures the spirit of D&D. The freedom to approach problems in your unique way, the genuine consequences for your actions, and the opportunity to build a party of quirky, flawed, and lovable characters all reflect the heart of the tabletop experience. Baldur’s Gate 3 might not convert every non-strategy fan, but it’s an undeniable masterpiece that rewards players willing to step out of their comfort zones. For fans of D&D, it’s a must-play—an epic adventure worthy of its legendary name.","Jan 21, 2025",steam
"10/10 Larian took everything they have learned about RPGs from their previous games and gave a masterpiece. This is the closest you can get to playing D&D as a videogame. Immense variety in customization. Loads of ways to approach or solve each encounter. Well-written dialogue with a character focus. Each playthrough can feel completely different. The maps are very open and huge, allowing you to take the story however you want. An epic tale intertwining characters both old and new, they did the franchise justice. Local split screen - Play it with someone!! No loot boxes. No micro transactions. No live service model. No paid dlc - everything they released after launch was free. They refused to make a sequel or add-on because their team was burned out. Years of post-launch support both fixing and adding things the players wanted. This is what we should expect from the gaming industry. Bravo, Larian. Bravo!","Nov 12, 2025",steam
"Absolutely wonderful game. While some might argue that it's not a perfect sandbox, the amount of choices the designers have planned and accounted for is not only impressive but a sign of true consideration for the players and what they may want to explore, try and do.

With 6 playthroughs under the belt and more planned for whenever the mood strikes me, I fully reccomend BG3 to any CRPG enjoyer out there.

The tactical combat system, deep character interactions, and narrative freedom were elements that made my journey unforgettable.

"First time in a very long time I've been this excited for a new release. So many lately have been overhyped, overmarketed, overpromised and ultimately lacking. Day 1 DLC, game breaking bugs, some that even cooked graphics cards. It's satisfying that I bought a game that feels complete start to finish. It's normal to have some bugs on a game release. There's no such thing as the perfect game, even when looking back through the nostalgia glasses, so it's not the expectation of perfection. It's the expectation of enjoyment and functionality without having to worry about microtransactions, time wasters, live service, and all of the other baggage that goes along with most releases these days. And this game by no means is completely unique in that regard, we've seen a couple that have been like that, and they deserve the same praise. The story is solid from start to end, and the largest complaint I could have about any specific section wasn't the content of the section but that I wanted more of it. Wanting to follow questlines to their fullest, wanting to explore minor characters more fully and just be further immersed in the writing and *effort* put in. How so many references are a love letter to the previous Baldur's Gate games and Faerun in general but also expands upon those things further, becoming its own thing in its own way. How it can make references to lore entirely outside the scope of the game, and make it meaningful but not devastating to those that don't know that lore. The gameplay is also satisfying. It uses 5e as a base, but makes several incredibly important changes that work very well for the nature of a video game (and quite frankly some of them would be good for our tabletop game as well). The rebalance of certain features (or entire class, as the monk goes) works well, making thus far every class I have tried across custom characters and origin characters feel impactful. Having a philosophy of fun over balance, but still maintaining genuine difficulty with many of the encounters is a masterstroke. Beyond that we have the options available at any given point. In past crpgs we all experienced the severe limitations of how to complete the quests. That didn't make them bad; I loved the Neverwinter series, the Baldur's series to this point, and both pathfinder games from owlcat. They're all games to be lauded and appreciated, being those that came before and the building blocks for those that came after. And build Larian did. Having played both DOS games and seeing the progression from one to the next not only in engine but in story scope. Rare in the old days could you take a quest and complete it in a completely different way. A few times per game. Now I've found that rare are the times where there is only one solution. While these types of games will never have the modularity and freedom of a tabletop game, this is the closest that gaming has gotten to it. In reference to those twitter threads, reddit posts, and memes galore- Larian raised the bar. You may not like it, but it's happened.","Aug 14, 2023",metacritic
"Playing BG3 after a 3 year break from early access has me completely enchanted all over again. With a combined effort of patience and early access player feedback, the Larian team has crafted a masterpiece.

I'm hopeful both Wizards of The Coast (@wizards) and Larian (@larianstudios) build on this success, and of course more epic tales in Faerûn !","Aug 7, 2023",metacritic

"Currently having around 50 hours of gameplay and didn't finished my first playthrough. However, it is already time to write the review for it :-) First of all I am a Baldurs Gate Veteran. Played part one already when I was a child and didn't understood all the gameplay mechanics behind - still loved it. Played Baldurs Gate 2 when I was older - understood more, loved it. Now guess what: I love Baldurs Gate 3 as well. It starts already when you start a new game and go into character creation - pure nostalgia. The graphics of the game is beautiful and it fits well to the gameplay. The character development and the whole fighting mechanics feel just great. The only critic that I have is that for me the map design feels a little bit linear. What I especially liked about BG1 and BG2 was that you when you started and played through the prologue you could nearly go everywhere and travel around. With BG3 you feel a little bit trapped in the map - but just a small critic point. I recommend this game fully!!!","Jan 14, 2026",steam

"I am 78. My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old. When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide. After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side. Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay. After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as. Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends. I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together. Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that. Thank you.","Jun 22, 2025",steam

"Great game, and probably the most influential one in the past decade for CRPGs. It can probably serve as a good entry to the genre for most people. In typical Larian fashion, the game starts out great, but loses steam toward the end. The good: - Probably the best companions the genre has to offer in the past decade. - Unmatched voice acting. - An amazing soundtrack. - Excellent Act 1–Act 2. - Cutting-edge graphics. - Good reactivity; you truly feel like the game reacts to your choices. - A faithful adaptation of DnD 5e. The bad: - The UI and everything about it. It feels clunky, near-impossible to play without mods. The camera gets in the way, the characters move around randomly sometimes, stepping into traps. Submenus in submenus. Some things feel purposefully hidden, like multiclassing. - OPENING EVERY CHEST takes ages. - About 60% of the game is just getting from point A to B with horrible controls. - WAITING in combat: sometimes you have to wait a good 2 minutes until every enemy acts out their turn. - DnD 5e is not a good system, in my opinion. Sure, it works as an entry to the CRPG genre, but it's nowhere near as good for storytelling as Pathfinder 1e, for example. - Act 3 feels really disjointed. - Act 3 brings back loads of characters from the previous entries (BG1–2) but doesn't do them justice. In fact, that's probably the weakest part of the game. (besides the terrible UI) - The itemization is weak. Some items are interesting, but nowhere near as game-changing as in other CRPGs.","Dec 26, 2025",steam

"Not my favorite combat compared to Larian's previous title, Divinity Original Sin 2, which made me feel like every single action had a good snap to it. Here in Baldur's Gate 3, however, there is a high miss rate for you and your enemies, which made me feel more like ""eh whatever"" rather than being engaged and frustrated in a good way (which is what I get from my hundreds of hours playing XCOM Long War 2, probably a good example of a good combat with a lot of miss). The overarching plot isn't that deep or reflective, but it doesn't hurt either. The first cutscene of the game already establishes a good sense of urgency, plus a strong reason that binds you to the other main characters of the story. The first 20 hours were incredible. I felt like I was getting big emotional moments akin to Chrono Trigger and Mass Effect 2 at a much higher pace than those games. However, BG3 does eventually start to drag and lose the magic due to many big maps (that are excessively big for no reason) and a big amount of characters that, while good for the extra content, often doesn't impact the game in any meaningful way. That's when it hit me that Chrono Trigger and Mass Effect 2 are still above this. So, I guess the best way to play this game is to ignore quests and just focus on roleplaying, which makes perfect sense when you take into account how you can always come back to any area you want and that many of the rewards doesn't do much (so logically, your character building isn't threatened at all from simply playing the game) Overall, I'm satisfied for the first 20 hours, which were unforgettable for me, and I appreciate the work put into cutscenes, voice acting and character building. Is this my favorite game? No. Does this beat the RPG experience of vanilla Skyrim? I don't think so. But still, I'm glad this game exists.","Oct 08, 2025",steam

"Quite possibly one of the best games I have ever played. A must play if you enjoy rpgs and game craftsmanship. Characters are well designed and very likeable (Lae'zel My Beloved), very well written and got their own personalities and ideologies. Story always manages to keep you hooked and wanting to know more. Even if a small portion of the world is involved it still feels pretty big. Character customisation is pretty good, it aint no Black Desert but it does its job. Many classes to choose from, some feeling more useful than others but still relevant in their own way. The art style is quite unique and well crafted. While in the middle of writing this review I glanced over all the images shown above and was able to identify where each one was taken. Cant name many games where Im able to do that. Soundtrack is phenomenal to say the least, maybe more instrument songs to play with friends would be nice but still very cool.

"Excelente jogo.ainda não terminei mas acredito que estou bem perto, e já joguei mais que o suficiente para dar meus dois centavos. Muitas possibilidades de builds e resoluções de quests, como todo mundo gosta de citar, mas os encontros em si são muito bem feitos e nas batalhas contra bosses você sempre tem um jeito de facilitar a luta se entender bem o que o jogo te perde(exceto quando a luta está bugada, como no combate contra um certo vampiro...). Os arcos de seus companheiros são bem satisfatórios, alguns deles você pode não gostar nada a princípio, a maioria na real, mas se der uma chance vão ver que eles tem bastante profundidade, você pode tentar guiar seus companheiros mais trevosos para luz ou deixar abraçar as trevas mesmo, não sei se dá para tentar fazer o mesmo com a galera mais boazinha porém. Numa nota mais negativa, bugs ainda acontecem bastante no ato 3, e infelizmente uma consequência dos contantes updates é que há mais riscos dele ocorrerem, alguns são engraçados, outros podem quebrar parcialmente quests(tenho uma que embora possa continuar foi dada de maneira errônea como concluída do jeito ruim, de modo que o jogo nem marca no mapa o quê fazer e nem diz o próximo passo no Journal), outros são só irritantes, como o de que todos os summons somem se eu carregar um jogo salvo no acampamento.

"Hard to understand how this won so many awards. In my opinion, it is a terrible GAME. Which is to say, the mechanics of the video game itself, built around a psuedo-5e ruleset, are among the worst of any video game I've ever played in 30+ years of gaming (including playing DOS games as a child). Camera controls are horrible. I spent 8 hours constantly wrestling with framing my characters and the battle maps so I could effectively see what was going on. You can't zoom out as far as you would want to. Bumping the side of the screen immediately disables the camera lock on a character, which you then you have to re-enable with a key bind or menu. Movement controls are infuriating. Click to move makes no sense when you're not in combat. Why in gods name they decided not to allow WASD or joystick movement out of combat...I have no idea. I've never played a Larian Studios game before, so perhaps this is the standard, but it's terrible. In my 8 hours of gameplay, at least half of it was mis-clicking. Either moving a character I didn't want to move or using an ability I didn't want to use or using an item I didn't want to use. If you are in any way familiar with DnD rules, particularly 5e, you will find this game annoying. It is not a benefit to have previous experience with DnD, in fact, it is a liability. For obvious reasons, they could not simply import 5e rules 1:1. Those rules were designed for a TTRPG not a video game. There are a myriad of SLIGHT changes to familiar rules which will result in consistent unexpected consequences to mundane decisions. Everything from what qualifies as a Bonus Action, to how long a spell/effect lasts, to the resource cost of spells and effects are just SLIGHTY different enough to require you to relearn an entire new set of gamerules. Obviously, that's not terribly different from playing ANY new video game, but it does mean that if you have 5e knowledge and habits, you have to UNLEARN them before you can learn the game. Finally, my biggest complaint about gameplay is the lack of clarity when it comes to the consequences of dialogue choices and combat actions. It is very easy to make a decision you believe to be mundane only to find it has far reaching consequences. Dialogue options are locked in, which of course they are, it would be impossible to create a video game that can anticipate any and every line of dialogue a player might want to use. However, unlike an RPG game like Knights of the Old Republic, the options presented to you give no indication as to the direction the line of dialogue is going (for example: Polite, Rude, Insulting, etc). The dialogue options simply list what skill you are using, but Persuasion has a myriad of intentions and result. As the game does not have a human DM that you can argue your case with, nor does it have a simple way of undoing an action (outside of Save Scumming, which is neither fast nor easy), I ended up repeatedly making ""decisions"" I had no intention of choosing that were not in line with the character I was trying to emulate and suffering negative consequences as a result. While playing a Paladin, I attempted to save Lazael from a brother-sister pair of tieflings who were intent on killing her because ""she's a demon"". In other words, they think she's dangerous because she is an alien (githyanki) and they erroneously believe her to be dangerous. Understandable and typical. Nothing wrong with the scenario. However, the paladin dialogue option results in a fight, and if you kill or knock one of them unconscious you are branded an OATHBREAKER. For protecting an innocent from a murderous misunderstanding. This would never happen at the table top, because you would be able to explain the situation and argue your case with the DM. You do not have this option in the game. Instead, you only have the option as a Paladin to attempt a DECEPTION roll. Beyond frustrating. It resulted in the loss of hours of gameplay, as I did not have a save state since the crash. I'm sure the rest of the game is as everyone says it is: filled with hundreds of hours of fantastic voice overs, rich story, and deep lore. But they certainly don't make it easy to GET there. Just one man's opinion, one that is clearly not widely held. EDIT: I forgot to mention that my complaints are repeatedly met with ""just MOD it"" or ""there's a MOD that fixes that"". That's nice. I personally don't mod my video games. I prefer to play them vanilla. I also think that the base video game should be playable WITHOUT mods. In fact, I don't think that is a very high bar to set. Mods should add content to a game, not fix glaring issues. Again, just one man's opinion.","Apr 07, 2025",steam
"Years after release, and still 1/3 of my played time is contending with crashes. Ive never seen so many crashes that cant be fixed because third party mods are being blocked, so the mod community cant even do their jobs for them anymore. I reserved judgment for literal years despite this game being unplayable and insufferable in pre-release, and now, the game has to crash three times every time it boots up, going through setup every damn time. Mod conflicts that dont appear until late game with *approved mods* require starting the game over from scratch, rather than just removing the mod, because apparently indie programmers writing third party mods are better at their hobby than larian studios programmers who are so-called ""professionals. At this point, replace your programmers, this is pathetic. Do better Larian.","Mar 26, 2025",steam

The amount of content here and the level of production at play is insane. All for the previous gaming norm of $60. A sum this game earns every penny of as it is my most played game in Steam. I am as upset about $80 games as everyone else. However, I would drop my convictions in a heartbeat for this game. My playtime is only beaten by some multiplayer games that I got deep into when I was younger, though Skyrim is also up there, admittedly. And that's without having even fully completed the story a single time. All endings of the story could be the worst in gaming history and it would barely impact my thoughts on the game given the amount of enjoyment it has already given me. If you don't enjoy turn based games then this game likely does not do enough to win you over. However, other than that I feel it is at least worth trying if you're looking for a game to sink your teeth into. If you have gotten to the year of our lord 2025 without playing this then you are eating good this year. Being able to experience this for the first time in a year with many other amazing releases would be a damn good position to be in. Finish Oblivion Remaster and Claire Obscur then pick this up easy peasy. Naturally, if you're a fan of the Divinity franchise then this game will also offer you a lot. As Larian has certainly carried over some DNA. Though the combat system may take some adjusting, especially considering it is a common criticism I see from DOS veterans when talking about this game.With that in mind, I still find the DnD 5E implementation here to be very fun overall. And it is still a turn based isometric rpg, obviously. So Im sure it will still scratch that itch for fans even if you may find the implementation worse than Divinity overall. With all of that said, now that we are at the end of the content cycle for this game it just seemed like an appropriate time to give my thoughts on the game. And thats basically all this review its, as there is little detail. Just me glazing the game up and down for a few paragraphs. So give it a try if you havent already. If you have and its not your cup of tea, thats ok. But, for me, it has cemented its place as my favorite game of all time. And is one that I would easily recommend.","May 23, 2025",steam

"This game is a masterpiece in terms of story, scope and player freedom. I'm not usually one to replay games but I have done 6 playthroughs and still not seen all this game has to offer. The narrative and combat build possibilities are functionally endless and balanced well enough that any approach to the game is not only possible but often comes with unique outcomes. A few issues to be fair are that it’s fairly unapproachable to people who are wholly unfamiliar with TTRPGs and because of its scope it can lack some polish if you look too closely in some places (mainly with tooltip issues and undocumented or unintended combat interactions.)","Oct 25, 2025",steam

Got interrupted on my first play-through because my steam deck broke in Iraq. When I got back and set up I found it again and dropped like 400hrs into it. The gameplay is just cerebral enough. The characters are written and voiced very well and they give off strong unique personalities to a point where they really convince me to change my mind every once in a while. The aesthetics are on point for everything other than the music which I think is fairly mid. The role playing aspect is maybe the best in any game I’ve played. Highly recommend this game it’s in my top 5.,"Nov 23, 2025",steam

"A good DM wouldn't design a fight where your players get stun locked and there's nothing they can do about it. A medicore DM would design the encounter, but would fudge the numbers if they realized their players weren't having fun with the encounter, maybe even cut it short. A bad DM would design the encounter, keep the rolls straight, let the party get TPKed and end the campaign just like that. This game being based around 5e's system made me think that it'd be a fun experience similar to DND. But without the DM there to actually contextualize actions past their baseline interpretation, the game very quickly loses that aspect. I can understand if Halsen, wildshaped into a bear, thinks we're going to leave him to the goblins and becomes hostile towards us. But once we use him breaking free as a distraction - stopping and One and Three from going to get reinforcements, killing the rest of the goblins, never once attacking him directly - you'd think he'd realize ""oh, these guys are actually helping me!"", and drop the hostility... But of course, such a stupid idea is one that only a DnD player could come up with. I would know, I'm not only a player myself, but also a DM! So of course without a DM he just remains hostile on us. But if we do non-lethal damage, maybe we can just knock him out and drag him to the Cove? Nope! You knock him out - again, NON LETHAL DAMAGE - and the game fails the quest and acts like you killed him! Okay, fine, whatever. It is what it is. Can't account for all possible routes of stupidity when you're making a game this open ended. But you have to at least BALANCE it. You can't expect a party of 4 at best to actually Want to fight off an entire goblin army, so give them a way to avoid that. Gut lets you do that! You can lure her into her room and kill her without the rest of the Goblins noticing. The other 2 goblin leaders, the hobgoblin and the drow lady - you can't do that. So how are you expected to kill the leaders without Alerting the Hoard like you bumped the pixel of a car in L4D? You simply Don't. You go back to the cove and you rest and you warn them the next day and you make your players feel stupid because there's genuinely no other option that doesn't incite a war. And then there's Auntie Ethel. Sweet innocent bog hag Ethel. Who can duplicate herself up to SIX DIFFERENT TIMES, and EACH DUPLICATION ACTS AS ITS OWN ENTITY. They don't share resources, concentration, actions - NOTHING. The party size is capped at 4. Now you might just say ""erm the dupes disappear after one hit just attack them 5head."" Okay wise guy I'll do that when I get out of this Hold Person. Except I can't because the moment I do Ethel #5 puts me in another one. So you just sit there and watch as your whole party gets STUNLOCKED and pissed on with poison spray.","Sep 12, 2025",steam

But I do have to point out that there is a little bit of bad, near the end of the game there are several bugs and small glitches I ran into, that to be fair was so incredible I pretty much did not run into any until that moment with so many moving parts in this game, so be aware that Act3 really is somewhat buggy.

"Solid 7/10 I know that many people absolutely love this game. However, there are quite a few things I personally didn’t enjoy, and it often feels like most players prefer to focus only on the positive side of game. Let’s start with the pros: a huge world, a wide variety of game mechanics, strong replay value, and good optimization. Larian has clearly put a lot of effort into this game, and it will probably be remembered for many years. Players will keep replaying it and finding new things every time. Now for the cons. Everything written below is purely my personal opinion, and you may disagree with it. Maybe this is part of Larian’s signature style, but Baldur’s Gate 3 constantly puts the player in front of difficult and often dumb choices. Sometimes these choices feel so absurd that I just want to make no decision at all and close the game. Very often, you’re forced to choose between two dumb outcomes - for example, between your own death or letting someone else die in a much worse way, while knowing that you might get testicular cancer. Sometimes during dialogues, you have to pass several skill checks, and since this is a DnD-based game, you can easily fail them even if your skill level is high. This isn’t exactly a downside. It’s actually one of the game’s strengths. But if you’re on a second playthrough and want to get a different outcome from a quest, this can make things quite frustrating. Throughout the game, you meet characters with their own personal motives. From the start, some of them clearly show that they want to use you or might even harm you. At the same time, you can’t really do much about it, because they are important to the main story. You’re basically forced to go along with it and let these characters act however they want. The same problem applies to companions. If you choose not to help a companion with their personal quest, or if you solve it in a way they don’t like, they can get offended, leave your party, or even attack you. In some cases, characters may become hostile or distance themselves from you even if you genuinely try to help. This isn’t really about gratitude or morality. The game has many deep and well-designed systems, and NPCs can react differently depending on your actions and the situation. Still, there are moments when their reactions feel incredibly stupid or completely unpredictable, especially when you expect something more logical.","Jan 09, 2026",steam

"Come sempre la critica fa il suo lavoro in maniera pessima, leggo di voti come 80,90 o 95 per questo titolo. L'opera di Larian studio è da 100 senza alcun tipo di compromesso, i ""difetti"" elencati sono tutti risolvibili tramite patch e sono cose che NON compromettono l'esperienza del videogiocatore on nessun modo. L'industria videoludica si divide in giochi fatti veramente bene ma recensiti male e in maniera oggettiva e giochi con mappe nemici e meccaniche riciclate che vanno avanti grazie al loro nome e ai pareri sempre oggettivi dei recensori. Baldur's gate 3 offre una libertà immensa con diversissimi modi per arrivare al finale (ben 17000 modi diversi), il combattimento a turni e coinvolgente è presenta chicche interessanti (ad esempio altezza e peso vengono considerati così da far stordire il nemico o farlo cadere magari in un pavimento crepato), l'ambiente circostante è un elemento da tenere sempre d'occhio durante i combattimenti dato che possono esserci elementi che danno vantaggio al nostro avventuriero (come:barili,oggetti sospesi fino ad arrivare anche ai tetti dove è possibile arrivare con i ****). Il party è veramente importante parlare con loro è legare porterà solo che vantaggi (oltre che a moltissime romance), ogni run cambierà anche in base al vostro party e alla peculiarità di ogni ****, ad esempio avere un **** con maggior percezione rispetto a noi può portarci a scoprire diversi segreti presenti nella zona di gioco così da condurci a qualche tesoro o qualche sorpresa inaspettata. La personalizzazione del proprio **** è a dir poco fenomenale, si possono fare creazioni in maniera curata e ben dettagliata che vi faranno perdere ore e ore per quanti elementi si possono cambiare a seconda della razza scelta. La trama è piena di spettacolo e di emozioni, ci troviamo nei forgotten realms di D&D, non si sente mai un singolo momento di noia e si respira sempre aria di avventura e magia.Ogni NPC circostante ci può portare sempre a una variazione cosi da far vivere ogni atto in maniera completamente diversa a seconda delle nostre azioni o dell'approccio che abbiamo avuto. Non ho voglia di continuare a scrivere perché sarebbe davvero troppo lungo spiegare tutto ma Baldur's gate 3 è un diamante ben fatto e ben lavorato che porta solo alla perfezione.","Aug 18, 2023",metacritic

I'm not much into round based games but i got used to it. To be honest as an anxious gamer i appreciate this type of combat now because there is no time pressure or panic-brain-freeze. It was perfect for me that i waited over a year to buy it because now there are so many fixes and mods (i get them on nexusmods.com) so i can mod it to the perfect game for me. You can even mod spiders into dogs appearance for those with arachnophobia. Be aware that there are kinky/spicy scenes and romanes you can encounter if you want. I love the interactions so much and the graphics are just stunnig. So many clothing and equipment possibilities! (To be fair you should tidy up you inventory as good as possible to not have chaos). I highly recomment to follow the Motioncapture actors like Neil Newbon - who was the actor for Astarion - on social Media.

I have never played anything like this, Itll probably be a long time before I ever play anything like this again. If the price tag is putting you off, you dont wanna sink £60 into a game you might not like. Just know that i'm sure people would play double or triple the price for this game. It is genuinely just that good. 80 hours in and theres no way i've found or done even half of all the content in this game, and with a modding scene that is kept alive and supported by the devs, its an experience you are missing out on, and a game that will just keep you coming back even when youve got much better things to do.

"Has way more in common with Larian's Divinity: Original Sin games than with the first two Baldur's Gate games, but this truly is one of those generational cornerstones that people are going to look back on for years or decades. It doesn't do anything revolutionary, but everything it does it does well. The story is great and your choices actually do matter. The combat has one of the best turn based systems I've ever played and a ton of variety. It plays fast and lose with D&D rules and I wish it had things like the ready and dodge actions, but it's faithful enough to be easy to make the transition.","Mar 24, 2025",steam
"""Baldur’s Gate 3 is an outstanding experience from start to finish. The gameplay is engaging, with deep, tactical combat that rewards creativity and smart decision-making. The storyline is equally impressive — rich, immersive, and full of meaningful choices that truly shape the world and your character’s journey. I especially appreciated the attention to detail in the writing, the diverse companions, and the way the game honors the Dungeons & Dragons roots while making it accessible to newcomers. Every playthrough feels unique, and the replay value is huge. My only real gripe is the level cap — I found myself wishing I could progress my character further, especially given how invested I became in their development. That said, it’s a minor complaint in what is otherwise a phenomenal RPG experience. All in all, Baldur’s Gate 3 sets a new standard for narrative-driven RPGs. If you’re a fan of the genre, this is an absolute must-play. 4.7 out of 5!","Oct 05, 2025",steam

"A brilliant RPG, but not without flaws: As in Larian's previous DOS2, the scale seems to have gotten away from them. I wouldn't wish the game to be any longer than it is, but the third act seems to be half-missing. The expected contrast between criminality and seediness in the lower city with politics and power in the upper city simply isn't there. More importantly, the story seems to have changed between the writing of act I and the completion of acts II and III. The Chekhov gun shown in the first act is never fired. There's a suggestion that the Ilithid powers will cost the player something, but in the end they cost nothing. The game constantly pesters the player to use the tadpoles, and to pester party members to use them in turn, without a definitive option to say one will never do that, not to mention a reward for such action. Large parts of the game are about temptations of power, yet there's never a cost, for any character, for not taking it. The idea is instead introduced and then abandoned. The game isn't difficult enough for the powers to be important, despite the Emperor constantly stating that it is vital. In DOS2 one had to be careful what battles were attempted, here the only way to encounter real difficulty, even on the hardest settings, is to bring an unfamiliar set of companions to one of the bigger boss fights. There are too many companions. We don't really need Halsin, Jaheria and Minsc, who should have come and gone as NPCs. By the time they arrive they can only really sit at camp and provide commentary until the end of the game. Less would have been more. Failure could be made more interesting. Disco Elyisum, itself a mutated adaptation of Dungeons and Dragons, showed how failing a skill check can be just as fun as passing it, but these lessons have not been applied to other games. It would be nice also if the camp had been a bit more fleshed out. Some scenes between companions or variation, as in Mass Effect, would have made it seem more alive, rather than as a place to store companions. The music in the Elfsong Tavern is truly terrible to listen to while trying to sort inventory. As a game that permits a variety of approaches it is quite a success, and this clearly is where the effort went. There are so many different ways to go about things, it's a wonder that things don't break more often, but the bugs that remain are minor. It is nice that there are few ""puzzle"" battles with single solutions that cannot otherwise be completed. It's remarkably flexible, and very friendly to the player, allowing saving even during dialogue. It was a joy to play (three times!) and I look forward to whatever Larian do next, but I do hope they learn to scale their ambition to what can be done in the time available.","Jun 29, 2025",steam

Character creation and developing the same, and interaction with other characters and the world is so complex and satisfying 3. The world and story are so rich and immersive 4.

"I've played for 100+ hours and have yet to get to Act II. This game is so rich in story and has so many different ways of completing a single quest it's replayability is what reels you back to it: the what ifs. Graphics: This game is honestly stunning. Despite having a top-down view most of the time, characters are very well done and the scenery is so intricate with even small little interactable details all over the world. Combat: I have never played any turn-based game ever and it did take me a while to get used to the fighting in the game but once you get the usual ""attack and damage the oponent all the time"" mentality out of your head you realize there are SO many different ways of starting and ending a fight. If there is a ""what if i do X"" on your mind, then you probably CAN do it that way. Story: (As of Act I) Each main character is finely crafted and each has a story to tell and depending on your choices could make a sharp turn each time you talk to them and not only on the main story. Every character has a reaction to things you do/decisions you make throughout the story and it is what makes them exceptionally well crafted. This will be updated once i reach Act II and Act III.","Dec 03, 2024",steam

"I had the game for about a year before I gave it a real shot. It was not the game I expected it to be when I jumped in. I didn't realize that combat was turn based, that everything in the game had a purpose, mobs do not re-spawn, and that there's TONS of secrets and miss-able content. The replay value is through the roof. As soon as I got the ""A-ha"" moment, it was truly game on! from there. I was hooked! every day I just just couldn't wait to get back to my group and see what would happen next. I made a lot of mistakes with abilities, character builds, and story content....or did I? I ended up playing through the end and Wow wow wow was I blown away with everything packed in BG3. This is a game where you take your time, think about your approach and just have a blast. No game is perfect. Not every game is for everyone, but this game just hit all the right notes for me. I fell in love with the story, the characters, all the story arc's and just about everything else the game threw at me. If I had any complaints, they would be minimal. I may not have had the same opinion if I played it earlier than I did. I started my first play through after patch 8. so maybe I got lucky by having the latest version with most/all of the kinks iron'd out? I'm not a poet or an English major, so the level of praise and the words I want to use to sing praises isn't my strong suit. What I can and will say is that BG3 is on my top 10 all time list forever. I've been playing games since NES, so I've been gaming a long time and this is the kind of game we used to dream about when I was a kid on my 8 bit system wondering what the future of gaming would look like. BG3 is the end product every dev team out there dreams of making no matter what type of game they are producing. the polish, the detail, the love, the ambition! its all here, and its very easy to dive back in on a new game and have a very different experience. So hat's off to Larian Studios for crafting such a wonderful work of art. I never thought this would be a game that I'd sink into for hundred's of hours and come out raving.

"I genuinely feel bad giving this a negative review. You can tell that alot of work went into it, there are rich storylines and well written characters, there's a good level of depth to the gear and the combat, the puzzles seem fun, it does a good job of giving you a blank slate to put your character into insofar as there is alot of freedom to act as you'd like, and talk as you'd like. But, maybe you're like me, confused to why this game is being hailed as the greatest thing ever made, because you've given it hours of your time, when every minute felt like a chore. Maybe like me, you wanted desperately to enjoy this game, but found yourself bored or frustrated, and nothing else while playing it. It could be because you can lose hours of progress to RNG if you don't save scum, it could be you don't particularly enjoy turn-based combat. It could be because after almost 8 hours, you've done nothing whatsoever. I wanted to like this game, I really did. I almost feel weird disliking it, solely because of how beloved it is. But there wasn't a single moment where I enjoyed playing the game. I came away from this feeling completely disconnected from popular opinion, and like there must be something wrong with me for not enjoying it. If you found this negative review in the sea of positive ones, you may feel similarly.","Oct 07, 2025",steam

"I'm extremely aware that I'm in the minority with this opinion but I thought BG3 was massively overhyped. My main point of reference that I was using when playing this game was Wrath of the Righteous, which I consider to be a much better game (although this opinion is also shared by few). Constantly, as I was going through the game, I kept finding myself saying 'this wasn't an issue in WotR'. Like, how the game takes the modifier from your currently selected character rather than the highest among the party. Or the limited party size punishing you for playing your own character instead of one of the pre-made ones. Or how the game is based on 5e DnD, which I consider to be a system so flawed, you have to Ship of Theseus the whole thing in order to get it to function well (which this game does do but I feel it would've been better if they used an entirely different system altogether). And these are just a few examples, although most other ones I have are admittedly much more nitpicky, but they just kept piling up the longer I played. To be frank, I think the vast majority of people like this game because of its production value. I've also had a few friends play this and WotR and even admit that they couldn't get into WotR because the production value was much lower and that said production value carried BG3 hard. The characters were pretty good but that feeds into my criticism about the limited party size. I don't wanna play Shadowheart or Karlach, I wanna play my own guy! And the game punishes you for doing that because one of its best features IS the characters themselves, so playing it the way I want to makes the game objectively worse, which left such a bad taste in my mouth, I'd rather they not even give the option in the first place to play your own guy. If you get this game, I am absolutely certain you will enjoy it. But I just, can't get behind it at all. I like WotR to much to like BG3. It has probably the best necromancer in any video game I've ever played.","Sep 07, 2025",steam

And if you wanted to play with your friends this game offers co-op for up to 3 others in your party. Finally another bonus is that the modding community is large which offers many mods coming from Steam/Nexus. The game had a lot of work and love put into this game and that's why I definitely would recommend Balder's Gate 3 to anyone who wants to play an expansive open world RPG.,"Dec 06, 2024",steam

"Product received for free TLDR: Yes the game is good, would recommend if you have several dozen hours of spare time. Baldur's Gate 3 is essentially a 3-way between a romance sim, a tactical RPG, and a storybook. All of which is wrapped in a beautiful bow of a variety of features and play-styles. Now if one of those feels out of place of the three, then you'd be right. We'll get to that when we get to it. Nevertheless, the game was constantly updated and clearly a passion project rather than something done for pure profit. There is a reason why the game took so long to release the full state and even then why they kept updating it some often passed its original release. Now that no more 'significant' updates are supposed to be released I feel it is comfortable for me to share my thoughts and story. DISCLAIMER - I got this game as a gift from my friends, which means I have 0 dollars paid. So this review although I hope can inform you about what I thought of the game and how I personally enjoy or not enjoy it (and will include spoilers) it will likely not tell you if the game is worth $70.00 USD. So I hope that this can be just one piece of information you can turn to for assistance in the decision making process to purchase BG3. PROS Let's state with Character Customization. This game has a lot of it. like A LOT. You can see within the first few minutes of what make your character look like from their clothes, skin, class, gender (which has multiple options good on you Larian), and even what kinds of backgrounds you can be. These options allow you to make the character YOU want and how YOU will tell the story. Since the game doesn't use voice for the main character Tav they are just a self insert. They gotta have some personality given to them, so you have plently of oppurtunity to do that. Now Character Customization also includes choosing your class as alluded to. Since this is a video game rather than actual D&D multi-classing becomes a lot more viable and silly. So many of the most absurd builds that (mostly) use the game's fun jank can be built with little effort on your part. Especially, since everyone can have their class changed or other aspects redistributed via Withers. The 5e system in the game (which ties into both the above and bottom points) is a variant on D&D 5th edition, specifically the 2014 rules. They have made some minor changes to certain abilities and spells that are barely noticible. The bigger changes are to the way class advancements work. But some classes (like warlock) suffer at higher levels due to a lack of increases. Instead they make slight modifications to subclasses to make them more optimal than their D&D counterparts. This is very apprent in their recent Arcane Archer addition. The side content is everywhere. A nook, a cranny, a random interaction with a shovel. They are everywhere. Onto the CONS You may have noticed something about the cons, they are all about the writing in the game. Before I get into it I'll give some positive thoughts about the game that relate to the writing but not really the writing itself. The narrator is very fun (despite it not being Kevin Michael Richardson like from BG1 & some of BG2). The actual voice acting is bloody amazing, literally every performance is oozing with charm and it is clear that some of the actors studied up for the rolls to get the right accents for some character such as Matt Mercer doing a mighty good impression of Jim Cummings which still being himself. With the voice actors out of the way onto the actual problems. The narrative is lazy. Yes you heard that right, lazy. For a game that was hyped up for being the #1 D&D sim, that will be like playing D&D at home and having fun and learning secrets. Every twist and turn is a 'why?' or a 'duh'. I will summarize the entire BG3 narrative without spoilers you ready? 1. You have object, someone wants object and hunts you for it 2. Object revealed to be secret weapon against big evil 3. You use power obtained from object to defeat big evil Finally... the romance thing. Look, I understand you want everyone to feel included. But the likelihood of everyone in the room being pan & wanting to bang is pretty unlikely. For a romance to work it needs to be something you have to strive or work towards. There is no work involved with these relationships, they are just there. Although you could say this is an issue with gaming at the whole at the moment, BG3 is just the most noticeable since well bigger audience. I hope this helps someone somewhere. This game is fun, just sometimes a pain for someone invested in the series.","Aug 25, 2025",steam

"I’m really torn writing this review. I’ve seen the acclaim and figured I need to try. And it took about 20h and two tries for me to get in to this game. And by hour 35 and the end of Act 2, I “got it”. The story was building. I loved my party. Choices felt impactful. I felt powerful.  And then there’s Act 3. I spent 15 more hours hitting walls and just not getting it. “Hurry Up!…oh wait, you’re under leveled so figure out the mail system. Then hurry up! Like. The world literally ends today!”  Larian did such a good job avoiding one of my least favorite issues with open world games - the “get it done now!” Plot running headlong in to the “but first, I want to learn how to craft pottery”plot. It’s jarring. Some people don’t mind. If you don’t, great! If you do, you’ll hate Act 3.  Finally, I read some “played it a while” reviews and I felt heard. Hundreds of people agreed. Something just changes in Act 3 and the game becomes nothing more than tying up loose ends you started earlier … with whimpering conclusions. Your party stops talking to you. Plots get confused and dialog starts making assumptions that aren’t true. All that immersion felt…was gone.  And that ***** because Larian absolutely made the closest thing to a table top game I’ve ever played. The systems. The flexibility. The hundreds of dialog branches. Did you remember to speak to the dead? Or maybe close a door? Those seemingly small ripples create waves later.  Until they don’t. And then it’s just a series of battles. Which…I got in the habit of twisting or avoiding. Because. Open ended RPG. And then I couldn’t.  So. That’s my review. Admittedly, I bounced off the third Act after 77 total hours played. I kept trying and trying. And I stopped having fun. And that’s the best rule of any game? Is it a 4 but fun? Have fun playing it! Is it a 10 but not your thing? Don’t play it.  So I stopped. And if some of what I said resonated , you may have to stop too.","Mar 7, 2025",ign

"This game is soooo good. I actually initially downloaded it for free, if you know what I mean, but after one playthrough I decided that Larian 100% deserves my money and bought it here. Now I'm on my second run and it most likely won't be the last. Seriously, support good game dev guys! I've never played older BG games or anything dnd related at all, so a lot of the game's mechanics were weird and dense for me, but the thing about this game is that it has so much soul it made me want to figure things out just to see how the story plays out. Also there's also so much variety in how you can approach different situations and quests that keeps the story fresh for different runs. The music is amazing (a bit of advice: ), the voice acting is great - it seemed a bit over the top to me at first, but you can just feel that the actors really care about what their characters have to say and it just sweeps you along for the ride. The game is ridiculously horny at times, but it's ok. I survived the second-hand embarrassment and you can too. Jkjk, romance is actually pretty classy in this game (most of the time, lol). And going back to the mechanics for a second, once you actually know what you're doing, it's just so much fun. There's a million different strategies you can try from grinding your way through might and magic, being clever and tactical or just one-shotting the bosses with explosives that feels almost like cheating.

"Be honest—I bought this game back then mostly because it was insanely popular at the time. I had NO experience with D&D-style games, so when I first started, I had no clue how to create advantages or remove disadvantages. Naturally, I kept getting absolutely destroyed by gnolls DAMNNNNN, which led to me rage quitting and abandoning the game for about two years I think ? Recently, out of sheer boredom or maybe a bit of pride, I decided to come back. After watching a bunch of guide videos and taking advice from people who had already beaten the game, I rebuilt my party into something that actually resembles a functional team. Suddenly, exploration stopped feeling like a survival horror experience(I killed all the gnolls yeahh). I used to rely on F5 and F8 to bend the story into the *correct* timeline—the one where I never fail a roll. But at some point, I decided to accept the dice as they are. If a check fails, it fails. I guess embracing that randomness is part of the game’s charm .. and part of learning to let go of control as a player——just like my life, unfortunately. sad.","Dec 19, 2025",steam

"So unbelievably overhyped and not at all worth that constant $60 pricetag. Edit if you want an actual response, holy paragraphs Batman. Apparently comments are limited to 1000 characters or this would've been a reply. TDLR: It's not really an RPG. It's hyped because it's a CRPG with motion capture and a fully voice acted cast, yeah I'm sure you and everyone else love seeing shadowheart rip off her clothes in 4k HDR. I didn't feel like writing a whole essay for my original review but I already made this response and I think a game like this deserves some elaboration. I appreciate anyone willing to put up with my opinion, I know this is alot of people's favorite game, and if someone made a review like this about Clair Obscur I would be mad too. Don't forget that you are ABSOLUTELY NOT allowed to criticize art in any way, ESPECIALLY not popular art that everyone likes, or that makes you a bad gamer and that's an irredeemable sin. I've actually never liked any video game ever, in fact I hate all of them and wish my hobby would just die already. With that in mind, here's what I dislike about the game: Every character is written with MCU dialogue. Everyone is witty and funny and ""we're all going on an adventure team!"" and it's so boring. I remember specifically Shadowheart saying ""I guess that's what I like about you, you're different."" Like seriously? My silent protagonist that has done nothing but stare and pick dialogue option number one the entire time is special? Why? Why am I different, literally tell me what I did, all we've done is battle and talk to people. It's just cringe all around, all the characters are cringe. That one annoying devil that just showed up and kidnapped me, then started speaking in poems as he tried to convince me he ""totally didn't want my soul for bad things, only good things."" Can you try at all? Or Gale who makes no attempt to come as someone you would even want in your party? Astarion didn't even join me until I needed a fourth member. Look at Ifan from Divinity Orginal Sin 2, he's immediately interesting. When you meet on the boat he's personable but still kinda mean, you can see there's more beneath the surface instantly. He's always meeting mysterious people doing very hush hush things, you want to know what the big secret is. I don't care about any of the companions or their secrets in BG3. Why should I? I can't interact with them like they interact with me, and most of them are really annoying anyway. I didn't meet a single character during my gameplay that I thought ""Oh wow, you're really cool, whether you're a companion or not I like your voice acting, story, and design so much that you're gonna be one of my favorite characters."" It just isn't there, it's like they made caricatures based off D&D and some MCU Collab Clorox they found in a shed. Every single dialogue is awkward because of the silent protagonist. Why are people just talking at me, and I'm just reacting? I can't give a little ""uh-huh"" whenever I nod or something? Combined with the seven different dialogue choices that all do nothing except progress the dialogue, why should I care about the dialogue at all? Yeah the voice acting is cool, but if I know they'll just say the same thing anyway, I'll just pick number one, read, and skip. It's like Larian looked at all the bad rpg dialogue trees and said ""Ok, so if we give them seven dialogue choices instead of five or three, then the illusion of choice will actually matter to the player."" No it doesn't. I ordered RPG with my CRPG, like it comes with the order. I shouldn't have to sit here and beg on my hands and knees to play a different game than other people are playing. ""Oh I've replayed Act 1 so many times, it's so reactive."" Literally how, show me the reactivity. I played for almost 11 hours and the world didn't acknowledge my existence at all, and it was made all the more obvious by the fact that everyone else was acknowledged because they had a voice! It's all fake, you know what a fugazi is? I hate this illusion of choice bs, it's the quickest way to turn me off a game. Also notice how nobody cared that I picked a Tiefling in the first quest? Here I am thinking ""Maybe the Tieflings will be different to me because I'm a Tiefling, and I can cast Tiefling specific spells and help them more than I would in say, a dark elf playthrough."" Lmao, why would I think there would be RPG elements in this game? Here's a couple random dialogue choices, they won't do anything different but maybe the character will mention tieflings in that response, then carry on with their original monologue. And they are monologues btw, I keep referring to them as dialogues but my party members were extremely silent the whole time. And your character just stares. Everyone else is having a grand old time but me? I'm just there to react. Grandpa died? Sad face. Grandpa came back from the dead? Happy face. Tell me more in great detail about how your grandpa came back to life, I'd love to sit and react to your story while I click different buttons to make you say things. Can we talk about the build variety I've been dying to talk about the build variety. What build variety? You get spellllllls, god I love spells. There's a scroll for this and a scroll for that, a spell for this and a spell for that. And you WILL be using the same party composition as everyone else is, because Astarion HAS to be a vampire rogue, and Lae'zel HAS to be a melee swordfighter. Which means your main character HAS to be viable or it throws the balance off, which means you get NO build variety. ""Oh boy I levelled up, what do I get?"" A stat increase, now clap. Maybe you got a spell or two. What am I even supposed to do with that, why should I care that my party members are levelling when they just get ""more powerful +1"". Oh and Act 3 is still unfinished apparently? Why didn't they patch it later, or was it all that motion capture that was getting in the way? The reality is whenever Larian got a license from Wizards of the Coast it was going to be terrible from the start. Of course WoTC is going to make them charge $60 constantly because it's Wizards of The Coast. Of course the ingame mod loader will disable achievements but downloading them from Nexus won't, it's WoTC and they're anti-competitive, and of course you will have Larian defenders blindly parrot ""every other game does it with mods."" Of course the game would be as dumbed down as possible, it's WoTC, they need to make it ""palatable for modern audinces"". Speaking of which, really crazy how they went with 5e and not 3.5e right? Such a little coinky-dink. Of course they have to make their money back for their really expensive motion capture and voice acting work. And, of course, there will be people that shut off their brain, plug their ears, and say ""lah lah lah, I can't hear you."" because they don't want to admit they didn't know what a CRPG even was before this took home every game of the year award in an objectively really mid year for video games. If you care about voice acting, and motion capture, and beautiful graphics, and shallow hot characters, that's fine! But be honest about it, don't go touting your game around as God's gift to the earth because it has all those things. The constant $60 implies quality, and in those things I can find quality in. But I wanted a CRPG, not a motion capture simulator. This is the only review I have comments on, I'm not a hater by any means. In fact I have a lot of respect for Baldur's Gate, they were generational games that went on to inspire a lot of my favorite franchise. But this game is mediocre, and it sacrificed all the role-playing to focus more on voice acting and motion capture. If anyone wants to debate that with me here, that's fine. Again though, stop acting like your game is made out of solid gold, because it very much isn't.","Jan 08, 2026",steam

"I'm in my fourties now and I had my fair share of RPGs in my time. No really I do have the time and the resources to play games pretty much as much as I want to.

Is it one if the best RPGs ever? Yes. Yes it is. To this day I know what I did in Daggerfall. I remember what I did in Dragon Age and I get goosebumps listening to the Mass Effect OST.

"After two failed attempts, I finally completed the game on my third try and it was absolutely worth it. Baldur’s Gate III is one of those titles that captivates you with its scale, writing, and sheer freedom of choice, making every session feel like a brand-new story. Each area is an adventure of its own. While there is a clear main mission, the real charm appears through exploration: side quests unfolding naturally, unexpected events triggering out of nowhere, and unique encounters that only happen because you chose a different path or interacted with the right (or wrong) character. The world reacts to the player in a way that feels alive, unpredictable, and genuinely responsive. The game’s decision-and-consequence system is at its absolute best here. There’s no “right” or “wrong” choice only different paths that meaningfully reshape the narrative, the world, and even your companions. Speaking of them, the game offers multiple recruitable companions, each with a rich backstory, personal struggles, and motivations. Building your party becomes not just a matter of strategy, but emotional connection. Another highlight is the incredible freedom in character creation. You can fully create your own character, customizing appearance, class, origin, and the moral path you want to follow. Want to be a noble hero? A manipulative schemer? A chaotic wildcard? Everything is possible and the world adapts accordingly. The game also allows romantic relationships, with one companion or several, depending on your choices. Larian didn’t hold back in exploring these dynamics, giving surprising depth to the bonds you can form. What’s truly impressive is that Baldur’s Gate III is clearly designed to be replayed multiple times. Every new campaign feels unique whether due to a new class, different decisions, or simply interacting with characters in fresh ways. In summary: Baldur’s Gate III is one of the most complete, rich, and rewarding RPGs of the last decade. It’s a game that celebrates curiosity, creativity, and bold choices. Anyone who dives into this world will walk away feeling like they’ve lived a personal epic.","Dec 02, 2025",steam
"Great story, nice graphics, but the combat is sloooooowww. Add to that, that the chance of missing a hit doesn't represent the percentages (I've experienced that you can easily miss at 99% hit chance, 3 times in a row), which doesn't make the combat fun or tactical. There are way better alternatives than random (incorrect) results after the role of the dice. I often reload out of frustration, which takes rediculously long on top of that. Furthermore, I found out that I've missed several quests since for some quests, there are no quest indicators on the map, while the quest menu is an unorganized mess (at least on the ps5). Actually, the whole menu structure is quite unorganized and rather illogical. Also,why does it have so many different spells, doing more or less the same, not even providing a particular and clear tactical advantage in battle, as well as limited spell slots and a limited spellbook? More focus would be better (Less is more).","Dec 23, 2023",metacritic

"I'll be straightforward: Baldur's Gate 3 is, in my opinion, the best game of the last decade. Of course, it’s not for everyone — at times it can feel overwhelming and slow, which may be a huge turn-off for some players. That said, the production value is absolutely insane. From the very start you’re given meaningful choices: a wide variety of races, classes, and origins. The story follows a general pattern, but it offers so many decisions and branches that every playthrough feels unique. Most games never even attempt this level of complexity because of the production costs. The gameplay is incredibly rewarding and demands a strategic approach — party composition, skill selection, and even when to rest at camp all matter. Dialogues are superb: there are many moments when you’re surrounded by enemies and can talk your way out instead of fighting. And when the fight does begin, it’s often challenging, which makes dialogue itself feel like a core part of the gameplay. Add to that the well-written companions and an engaging story overall, and you have Baldur’s Gate 3 — an absolute masterpiece. Honestly, I’ve been waiting for something like this since Dragon Age: Origins.","Sep 07, 2025",steam

"It went from great in act 1 to absolute crap in the last act. Bugs, severely limited abilities and honestly boring story. The last act seemed unfinished, with a lot more bugs and severe drop in cinematic quality. There were quests that we couldn't finish because the NPCs were ignoring us. The ending of the game was so boring we had to force ourselves to finish it and honestly, it was not worth it. Looking back, we should have finished act 2 and pretend that was the end of the game.","Jun 15, 2025",steam

"Game of the decade, hands down. Flawless creation is not possible. Once we get past this as a society I believe we'll enter a healthier place when evaluating media. BG3 is flawed, it is imperfect, it has bugs. That being said, these flaws hardly take us out of the experience. The experience is superb. It is built upon the foundations that stand before it, and it pioneers whole elements that enhance the player's experience to new heights. Not only do I thank all parties involved in the creation of this masterpiece, but I thank you for bringing new standards to the industry. With that said, I hope fellow players do not hold games of a smaller scope to this standard. If you have the means, you should purchase this game. Share it with your loved ones.

"An absolutely incredible game and experience. Overall, if it wasn't for Larian themselves, I would likely give this game a 9/10, but just due to the sheer care put into the game as well as the consumer friendly decisions (no microtransactions, no DRM), they deserve the 10/10. As far as the game itself, it is a truly remarkable experience. I just finally beat the game after 141 hours played. Overall, it was just incredible. I have never played a D&D game because I always felt they would pale in comparison. This game reminded me how fun it is to play a character. I spent over 2 hours in character creation alone. From the absolutely incredible (perhaps some of the best even) voice acting I have ever heard, an environment that keeps you guessing what's next, and turn-based combat that had me on my toes trying to figure out what to do next at times, this game truly delivers in every way. I loved how it looked, I loved how it played, I loved the story it delivered. To me, the tale **** RPG is one where you are considering your next character by the end of the first play through. I was considering my next character by the end of the first Act. There are some issues, to be clear. Act 3 can be quite buggy. i came across several bugs that at times I would need to reload earlier saves to resolve. But bugs can always be ironed out. A game needs a good core concept or it can never be fixed, and this game has it in droves. The only real criticism of the game itself is that I did feel as though the ending was missing just a bit more, though not nearly as much as some feel. I just feel like the end could have been slightly more fleshed out at certain points. Still, this did not hinder my enjoyment by much at all. I'll say this. There is a singular point in the game where you are fighting this individual who you've been having a mental dance with for some time. During this fight, the music because a duet between this person and someone else, and this person literally sings in the song, as you fight them. It is such an incredible and fun and just... unique moment. I cannot recommend this game enough. TL;DR - An incredibly beautiful game with dense storytelling, incredible amounts of player choice, combat that will test your mettle (or not if you just choose easier difficulty), and some of the best music and voice acting I have ever heard. If you are interested in a game that has more cutscenes that any game you have ever played and have an interest in turn-based combat, you should absolutely try this game.","Aug 14, 2023",metacritic
"I have nothing to contribute that has not already been said by thousands of other people. It's a great successor to the first two Baldur's Gate games, and and one of the best CRPG's I've ever played. The options for dialogue and choice are plentiful, giving about as much control over the story as you can hope for, and while there are some events where there is a clear evil path vs good path, there is still plenty of gray area that you can fall into without feeling railroaded like many other series. I will say that there isn't a lot of hand-holding, so for people who aren't familiar with D&D and/or Larian game mechanics, the learning curve can be really steep (though I did find the gameplay to be more intuitive than Divinity II: Original Sin). It's also extremely dense, particularly in Act 3; I'm about 120 hours in and I still have numerous quests left to complete before the endgame. Overall, I would say this is one of the best computer games to capture the experience of playing a TTRPG campaign, and while not perfect, it definitely deserves all of the accolades it has received.","Jan 25, 2025",steam

"If I could give ""mixed"" opinion, I would. I give it bad rating because it's overhyped. I'll probably get clowned but w/e Good: I mostly enjoyed combat, a lot of mechanics, build varieties etc., A lot of content The game is very creative, in story, characters and exploration It sucked me in during Act 1 and 2 Bad: -The biggest thing - ultimately I didn't care for the story or my companions. Something just didn't resonate with me. Party members range from mega cringe ones that I hated to tolerable, but I wouldn't want to hang out with any of them. I felt the same as when watching a modern show on Netflix. -The Mindflayers are overused in DnD, I almost hate the Gith'yanki, and those two are main pillars of the story. -After Act 1 there's a huge drop in quality and freedom, Act 2 is much more streamlined and Act 3 is just much worse. -Story and writing is often so cringe, it's hard to bear. People praise this game for writing, but no, it's not good. -I played BG1 and BG2 a lot and and was hoping for similar vibes here, but unfortunately it's different. It's a bigger problem with which direction the whole DnD went in (and the Modern sensibilities). -A lot of bugs, I started to play long time after release and finished on patch 7, and still the game had a lot of annoying bugs. -While combat mechanics are good and I appreciate the amazing possibilities they give, the balance was often bad. It's more of a DnD problem, but basically all combat is decided in the first round. You land that Stun on key enemy, you win, they land it on you - time to reload. End game combat is even worse when enemies to 40-50 damage per attack. So it's not much a long, tactical combat, it's just - position well, surprise them, hope for 2-3 main effects to land. -I felt like this game took way too long. I was wasting time on things that should be more smooth, everything is sooo sloow. It should've taken 40% of the time it took me to finish. -The UI, specifically inventory management. Oh my god, just frustrating. Camera is broken, targeting often doesn't work. Overall is it a good game? Sure Is it worth +100 hours? Not sure Is it game of the decade, or best game ever? No Does it have best characters/history ever? No","Jun 16, 2025",steam

Only 1 buff at a time, why? 5 - Why, on the other hand, physical damage characters are such a powerhouse? 6 - Why do I have to save the game before any ""jumping"" exploration because some of the party characters can get stuck and not be able to jump out of certain spots? 7 - Why after completing 90% of quests in the Grove region I am still underleveled to face enemies in the Underdark and the Mountain path?","Jun 29, 2025",steam

Tons of branching storylines and tons of secrets and unique interactions which are fun to find Very beautiful and creative landscapes and character models.

"BG3 is a special game. I initially didn’t love the combat because it was the first game with this type of combat that I had played. As I progressed through the game it became for fun. I also watched some videos on YouTube on how to properly build my character. This game its probably the best game when it comes to role playing in the fantasy genre. I have many other build ideas. I am writing this review after finishing the game. I did every quest I came across, but I’m sure I missed some things. Regardless my first play through on normal difficulty was at about 98 hours. It’s a long game, but if you enjoy RPGs it’s absolutely worth the money. The reviews for this game are absolutely warranted. It isn’t for everyone, mostly because of the combat, but once you figure it out it’s an amazing experience. Lastly, the replay value on this game is amazing. Yes you can have tons of different builds, but the dialogue choices are probably the best I’ve seen in a game. Next play through I will probably be a bad guy. I’m looking forward to seeing how much the game changes.","Dec 9, 2023",metacritic

It was hard getting used to the controls, and I screwed up a couple combats because of it, but it is a very fun and rewarding game! I do wish that the character customization was more gender inclusive. Personally, I don't care what genitals my character has, but I do care about their facial structure and if they have boobs or not, as that affects my experience more than what is not seen when wearing pants. Their male body types and facial structures are so blocky and muscular I don't like playing a dude, but I can't play a more twink type build without using a female body. As a note here, I'm non-binary and would prefer more androgynous options.

"The game is ok but far from being a good game, except the graphism, there are a ton of issue, but i'll explain in french: - Jeu truffé de bugs même après de nombreux patch (j'ai connu moins de bugs en jouant au dernier jeu pokémon...), mais bizarrement accepté comme étant une norme pour les joueurs PC... - Temps de chargement EXTREMEMENT long même avec un bon PC. - Un tutoriel très mal foutu, quasi absent, j'ai appris l'usage de la touche ""Alt"" uniquement grâce à des vidéos après 50h de jeu, par exemple ! - Les romances claquées au sol, on peut passer tout notre temps avec tel ou tel compagnon, avec une affinité excellente mais il ne se passera rien avec, et pourtant des personnages avec qui on aura quasiment eu aucune interaction vont nous forcer à coucher avec... car oui, soit on a une proposition pour les recaler très violemment, soit toutes les autres seraient même lorsque cela n'est pas dit explicitement des invitations à baiser. - On remarque que le second degré et l'ironie est totalement absent du jeu, càd qu'il faut prendre au pied et à la lettre tout ce qui est dit, ça tue l'immersion dans un RPG ! - La gestion des items est catastrophique, les items mettent parfois du temps à apparaître, le tri automatique est malfoutu, et on ne comprend pas pourquoi ils ne sont pas automatiquement rangés dans les sacs de notre inventaire, on ne sait pas quels items ont de l'importance ou s'ils servent juste à la revente. - La gestion de la caméra est au moins aussi catastrophique, notamment lorsque les combats se font sur plusieurs étages... - Quant au scénario et lore, il est bon et organique, mais loin d'être extraordinaire pour ne pas dire convenu. En fait c'est du niveau d'une prod netflix, ça se suit. - Pas de VF, Zelda TOTK et Starfield en ont, qualité qu'avait un jeu tel que TW3 aussi... - C'est un reskin de DOS2 avec un gameplay simplifié + jet de dé (qui selon moi n'est pas toujours pertinent). - Ll'exploration est très mal récompensée, surtout quand il s'agit de looter 150 pièces d'or et un vieux parchemin... une manière artificielle d'allonger la durée de vie du jeu en mettant plein de vases/caisses que l'on va vérifier dans l'espoir de trouver un objet un minimum précieux.","Sep 4, 2023",metacritic

"I love this game. --Updated for more info May 2025-- A game that revolutionizes the CRPG genre and proves that taking your time, treating your employees well, and being passionate about your game can make something truly outstanding. Larian went from a studio I hadn't even heard of to easily one of my favorite developers with a single game. I frequently think about games that came out in 2023 and think, ""wow there were some decent games"", but then see that was the year BG3 technically released. Literally isn't even fair for any other game that year, this was Game of the Year hands down.","Dec 04, 2024",steam
"Honestly, I stopped playing it after a few hours and never came back to it. The story and characters and world were good, but the party combat system was so wonky and unwieldy it annoyed the blip out of me. Also, many of the quests and resource gathering you do amount to ""go find this single pixel in a sea of 50,000 and then do that 20 more times."" All the movies they show you are not what you play. It's mostly your party running around on dirt paths and running into groups of OP enemies and reloading and retrying. I don't know what game they're showing in the videos, but it's far from the experience I had with it.","Feb 09, 2025",steam

"I think the fact that I've played this game for over 2 weeks of real time and I still haven't discovered everything there is to find in this game is a testament to the amount of love Larian put into crafting every inch of their interpretation of the Forgotten Realms. I think the gaming scene has been inundated with open-world fantasy RPGs for some years now, and it's exactly this type of game that has broken that mold for me in the most perfect of ways. I fully believe that Larian Studios should be the quintessential example of a dev team that cares about the product they're creating and respects the time and money their supporters put in. I'd recommend this game to literally anyone with or without a pulse.","Dec 03, 2024",steam

"I'm only 2.5 hours in but this is not matching the hype. I liked Original Sin. This seems, strangely worse than that game. The dice rolling was fun at first, but that thrill wares off quickly. I really don't know what the story is beyond just trying to get a bug out of my head and the heads of others. The combat with the spell slots, I assume is a DnD thing, is a bad mechanic. The graphics look like Dragon Age Inquisition but zoomed out and the camera is only one step up form a poor 2000s platformer. Why is this game so popular? Edit: So I gave it another 5 hours but the story and the characters are just not hooking me. For a game that I feel relies on its story, pretty heavily, I can't say its a good fit, at least not for me. The combat, Original Sin had its share of problems, with the DnD stuff and all the environmental ♥♥♥♥ you don't know until it happens, its a save scumming marathon.","Nov 16, 2025",steam

"This game is revolutionary. It is so descriptive and so in depth with the different conversation options you can have with different classes. Everywhere you go is important. You never know when you go around the corner what you walk into. You could all of a sudden go into a cutscene or a conversation you didn't even know you were about to have. Even every fight, sometimes you don't know if they are enemies or friends sometimes. The replayability is INSANE. I am already thinking about my NEXT player and what I am going to be. You can be one of the already made people which you meet along the way, or make one completely from scratch. This is an amazing game, and you won't regret paying full price for this one.","Dec 06, 2024",steam

"As someone who doesn't have a group of friends with the desire and/or, more likely, the time commitment necessary to start a real D&D campaign with, I find game is a fantastic way of getting more familiar with the breadth and depth of what it can offer. While there are some parts to BG3 that are a one-to-one match with it's D&D counterpart, there are others that are completely different. Regardless, it's an amazingly fun experience. Truthfully, many of my initial hours playing it was solo and, inevitably, I would find myself overwhelmed by not only having to build and play my character (whatever class they may be), but then having to understand building and playing each of my party members as well. This resulted in me stalling out on my first couple characters before even completing Act 1. Now I'm enjoying playing co-op with a friend, which allows me to learn how they are making decisions for the extra character they manage and can give me advice on how to handle and play the extra character I manage. That is helping me gain the confidence I need to actually entertain playing through the game solo after our co-op run is complete. I expect to be playing this game for many years to come.","Jan 23, 2025",steam

The turn-based combat is brilliantly tactical, rewarding creativity and smart positioning.

A wonderfully intense yet easy introduction and continuation of the D&D based games. 10/10,"Mar 14, 2025",steam
"Before playing this game the only other game from Larian and of the D&D genre was DOS2. When I played this the game was very intuitive and easy to understand, while still having challenge and a curve of things to learn as it grows depth. Graphically beautiful and while at first a bit unoptimized in certain areas, those have since been fixed. The story if great and there is a ton of side content, most will be missed on a first playthrough so highly recommend further playthroughs after a first. Each companion, and to an extent most side characters, have their own stories as well as personalities. Overall 9/10: This has quickly slotted into one of my favorite games of all time.

"It is without a doubt that the game in question will receive the title of ""Game of the Year"". The level of detail present in the game is truly remarkable, ranging from the intricacies of the musical score to the staggering 174 hours of cinematic content. Furthermore, the combat system is a flawless adaptation of the original Dungeons and Dragons game. It is perplexing to encounter negative reviews of this game, particularly those from individuals who lack a fundamental understanding of turn-based RPGs. Criticisms regarding the length of combat and the abundance of cutscenes are unfounded and demonstrate a lack of comprehension. It is inappropriate for such individuals to provide reviews if they are unable to grasp the fundamental concepts of the game. It is suggested that they instead play games such as Call of Duty.","Aug 31, 2023",metacritic

"Baldur’s Gate 3 is nothing short of a masterpiece. Larian Studios has crafted an RPG that not only pays homage to its legendary predecessors but also raises the bar for storytelling, gameplay, and player choice in the genre. From the moment you create your character, you’re drawn into a rich, immersive world where every decision matters. The character customization is deep and flexible, allowing you to create exactly the hero—or anti-hero—you envision. The turn-based combat is a thrilling blend of strategy and creativity, staying true to Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition rules while remaining accessible to newcomers. The writing and voice acting are phenomenal. Every companion is memorable, with unique backstories, quirks, and motivations that make them feel alive. The moral dilemmas and branching storylines ensure no two playthroughs are alike, encouraging you to explore every corner of the game. Graphically, the game is stunning. The attention to detail in the environments, character models, and animations makes every moment a visual treat. The soundtrack is equally impressive, perfectly capturing the epic and emotional beats of the story. Baldur’s Gate 3 isn’t just a game; it’s an experience. Whether you’re a long-time fan of the series or a newcomer to the franchise, this is a must-play title that sets a new standard for RPGs. Highly recommended!","Dec 23, 2024",steam

"I have been playing this game since the release, and, in one week, I haven't managed to finish even Act 1 after 25+ hours (Real life and all that). Still, just the first act is more complete than 90% of the games I have played. Every corner you turn, there is a new secret, a new way to finish your mission. You can do everything you can think of doing and some you probably can't think of. At one point, I managed to talk my way into the enemy camp, mess up their ritual, and release the prisoners, then I placed a silence spell on a room, killed one of their bosses, went to the next boss, repeat. That one section reminded me of the Hitman games. Everything reacts to your choices, the game even realizes you have multi-classed and reacts to you. Remove your cloth and run around naked? People will comment on it. I think I can play the first act 5 times and still not get every variation and that's a 30-hour section.

"I came into this game not expecting much because of the turn-based aspect, but as I played it I realized it's not a problem at all, and in fact, the game would not work without being turn-based. As for the story/gameplay/environment, it's a run-of-the-mill RPG, with the DnD flavor that might appeal to people that play that game. I value the amount of choices in the game, that gives it incredible replay value, and the variety of classes and gameplay mechanics is insane. As for the graphics, it looks awesome. It has plenty of stuttering in the final act, which is rather annoying, but other than that it runs great. It was worth every penny.","Nov 02, 2025",steam

"Absolutely amazing game which is a worthy continuation of legendary BG1 and BG2 which i loved and play as a young teenager. I just finished my first playthrough and I have enjoyed it all the way through. Game is huge. I have tried to visit every corner and finish every quest and it took me 220 hours to do it. But it never gets boring. Main story is amazing and you are really making it your own based on decisions you take during playthrough. Sidequests are entertaining and engaging. There was not a moment when I felt like doing chores. I have two things which I would prefer differently though...: 1. Lack of party members and small party - only 4 party members give you very little space for experimenting and varying your set up. 2. Max level is only level 12 which doesn't give you access to most powerful and interresting spells and skills. Also, as a veteran of genre, which I probably am as I played many D&D type games, I made a mistake of picking balanced difficulty. Well, it was really easy. Only one ""hard"" fight in game was Raphael, but still fell on first try. And for example dragon Ansur didn't even get a turn. Strategical element of game was kind of non-existent due to it being so easy. And things like buffing are totally useless on balanced difficulty. Also kind of non-existent in game. Concentration during most of buffing spells I didn't really like neither, but ok, it is what it is. But none of my complaints are game breaking or preventing people from fully enoying beautiful and engaging story. It really does not have competition in this genre regarding quality of visuals and voice acting. Also, lower difficulty and simplified rules are great for people with no experience in genre. It is really easy to get into playing BG3 even if you have no clue what D&D is about. I see here some negative reviews regarding story or lack of tutorial - even probably written by same person under different accounts. Well, it is absolute BS. If someone says that story is missing, then it is absolute delusional idiot. And if you can't figure out how to play this in like 1 hour tops, then stay away from any game which requires at least slight use of brain forever. King of the genre stays for me convincingly Pathfinder: WoTR. And in terms of game mechanics I also prefer other games, like for example Pillars of Eternity, Neverwinter nights or even Divinity Original Sin. But in terms of perfect storytelling, Baldur's Gate 3 has no equal and it is absolutely worth playing. I will play definitely again, although I will pump my difficullty up.","Jan 31, 2024",metacritic

"Really great game, but the system itself make everything a slog. Having to roll dices for everything, missing what should be easy rolls most of the time, it really feel like the game always want you to loose and is definitely rigged against yourself. In the end, you always have to savescum your way through if you're seeking a specific outcome, either being in fights where you miss 3/4 of attacks, or in dialogues, being unable to interact with allies and such the way you want, which really lessens how fun every interaction could be overall. Compared to other game with similar gameplay, like Disco Elysium, this one feel way too punishing for me. So unless you're really a big fan of DnD or it's universe, make sure you know why you're buying the game and not just fall in the hype trap surrounding it.","Apr 27, 2025",steam

"First, forget the hype. Like most hyped games, that view is pretty distorted. The basic game is pretty good if you like turn based RPG's. The pros: The story is pretty good, the characters feel genuine, the women are attractive and clothing is optional lol. Cons: This will depend on your point of view, but everyone... and I do mean everyone... will try to seduce you. I'd like a toggle to reserve this behavior from a specific gender. So far, I have seen no mods to help with this. The unmodded classes and mechanics can be very unwieldy. The necormancer for instance needs corpses to make undead, and they all vanish whenever you take a long rest. That is horribly frustrating. Mods: These are both good and bad. Mods can save the day for this game, fixing the akwardness of the base classes and mechanics while adding new interesting ones. It turns an ok/pretty good game into a great one. BUT... this will also make the game more unstable. Crashes are a problem even with the base game, and mods make it worse.","Jul 31, 2025",steam
"“In a world teetering on the brink of oblivion, you made a choice… to play Baldur’s Gate 3. And what a choice it was.” A tale woven from dice rolls, desire, and dire consequences. Your journey began with a parasite in your skull and a thousand possibilities in your hands. You met unlikely companions—broken, dangerous, beautiful—and together, you shaped fate itself. You charmed devils, battled gods, and romanced vampires. You saved lives… or extinguished them. You faced your past, rewrote your future, and carved a path through a world that responded to your every move. Combat was not merely battle—it was a dance. A turn-based symphony of blades, spells, and tactical brilliance. And every dialogue was a roll of the dice—every word, a chance to change the world. You didn’t just play a game. You lived a story. And it remembered you. This… is .","Apr 05, 2025",steam
"This may very well be the best game of all time. It is, most definitely, the best game that I've ever played. Incredible character customization, incredible voice acting, and incredible execution and alteration of D&D 5th edition. This game is INCREDIBLY well executed in nearly everything it does. There is an incredible amount of content, to the degree that you'll likely never even see it all. I cannot, I repeat, CANNOT do this game justice in just this review. If you love unique and well-written characters-- and perhaps romancing those characters, this game is for you. If you love well-executed turn-based combat that nearly perfectly emulates-- and in some ways exceeds-- D&D 5th edition, then this game is for you. If you love spending an hour customizing your character with an expansive list of options and different looks, then this game is for you. And, if after all that you're still not completely satisfied-- the Devs made an in-game MOD MANAGER where the community can post all of their glorious mods to tweak and add to the game's experience. As a result, this game's replay-ability is effectively limitless. BUY THIS GAME.

"I was reticent to buy or play BG3 for myself, having already seen the main story play through on some let's plays. Thing is, I really wanted to avoid the whole romancing thing, unless the option to be a Matchmaker was an option: let's see how an Astarion / Shadowheart relationship work or Halsin and Gale, dialogue options and stuff, you know? But then the stars aligned: I got a new computer, I had some savings, and the game went on sale. Screw it, let's actually play. Now I can't stop playing. Already over 200 hours in just 2 months. I keep thinking of new build options, good/evil paths to take, NPC interactions I might have missed, loot to toy with. It's so much more than the Matchmaking (which I still want), and it reminds me of my days of when I played D&D with my friends in the early 2000s. BG3 earned GOTY for a reason, it's just that good. And the limit is largely your imagination. Now buy the game, make your all-Warlock run, and Eldritch Blast everything into the chasms!","Mar 27, 2025",steam
"A Landmark RPG That Raises the Bar – Deep, Beautiful, and Wildly Replayable Baldur’s Gate 3 is one of the most immersive and emotionally resonant RPGs I’ve ever played. From the opening moments, it wraps you in storytelling that feels personal, layered, and alive. Every character has depth. Every choice you make has weight. You’re not just playing a game—you’re living a story. The pros are too many to list, but here’s a taste: Incredible writing: Sharp, funny, heartbreaking, and clever—sometimes all at once. Whether you're new to D&D or a veteran, it respects your intelligence and rewards your curiosity. Companions: Some of the best-written and most compelling companions in any RPG. Each has a rich backstory, evolving relationships, and paths that react to your decisions. Tactical gameplay: The turn-based combat is deep but never overwhelming. Creative problem-solving is encouraged—you can charm enemies, shove them off ledges, or set the battlefield on fire. Custom characters: From race and class to personal background and dialogue style, you can shape your character’s identity and morality however you want. Immersive world: The environments are absolutely gorgeous and bursting with secrets. It feels like a living, breathing world. Replayability: Your choices drastically change how the game unfolds, and no two playthroughs are the same. Mod support: There’s already a thriving modding scene, and Larian has supported it well, letting players tweak visuals, balance, and even add features. There are a few rough spots: The length of the game, while a dream for many RPG fans, might be daunting for those looking for a shorter or more casual experience. Accessibility is a real issue. Visually impaired players have very limited support—there’s no text-to-speech for non-dialogue elements, and you actually need a mod to move the minimap. Other accessibility options, like scalable UI, better contrast, or auditory cues, are sorely missing. Still, for everything it offers—emotion, choice, creativity, spectacle, and sheer roleplaying freedom—Baldur’s Gate 3 stands tall as one of the most ambitious and lovingly crafted games in years. The care Larian poured into every scene is obvious, and it’s a triumph of storytelling and design that raises the bar for RPGs going forward.","May 14, 2025",steam

"In a month, I've managed to finish three full playthroughs of Baldur's Gate 3. This is now my favourite RPG of all time. It truly elevates the genre to new heights. Presentation is top-notch, with excellent voice acting across the board, beautifully motion-captured scenes, and wonderful music. In fact, there's one late-game boss that has my favourite boss theme of all time, which fits not only the character but the events leading up to it absolutely perfectly (if you know, you know). Every single member of the cast knocks it out of the park with their performances - even the minor NPCs with one line of dialogue. It's a joy to interact with them all. And the story is outstanding. There are so many minor interactions and special dialogue lines based on everything from the situation to your race to who's in your party to your class to even your subclass - I played a Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer on my second playthrough and noticed dialogue related to my character's draconic ancestry. It's that complex! Combat is quite fast-paced for a turn-based game, and every hit, every spell effect, and every kill is super satisfying. It helps if you enjoy turn-based combat to begin with, but this is some of gaming's best. There's so many little interactions with the environment, like being able to shoot braziers down, push statues over, shove enemies into chasms (a personal favourite), and so on. You can even throw enemies at other enemies! Combat is always exciting and a lot of the encounters are very creative. The overall story is just phenomenal. No spoilers, but I found the best way to play is to really get into your character's shoes and properly role-play as them. The bad dice rolls really gave my first character (a bard) that extra level of incompetence as he tried to bungle his way through every encounter. The good dice rolls made my second character (a sorcerer) feel that little bit more intimidating and powerful. I'm not saying it's wrong to ""save scum"" (i.e; reload a save when you get a bad result on a skill check), but it was so much more fun for me to live with my mistakes. All of your companion characters are extremely well-written and all have great moments, ranging from hilarious to tragic. Romance is... abundant. The game's a bit too horny sometimes! But seriously, committing to one character and watching your romance blossom alongside their own personal story is a wonderful experience. Questing is excellent. There's so many outcomes, and so many variations of consequences, that no two playthroughs will ever be the same. And that's not hyberbole - as I said, I've done three playthroughs, and they've all been wildly different. The main story eventually leads to the same conclusion, but even that has a bunch of different choices and outcomes. There's a ""big choice"" at the end but all of the events leading up to it have an impact. It's not like Mass Effect 3's RGB ending by any stretch of the imagination. I'm going to echo a lot of player sentiment here, but Baldur's Gate 3 is what I wanted a Dragon Age: Origins sequel to be, in every way. It does everything that game did and then some, bringing that peak Bioware style to the modern age. Hats off to Larian for finally delivering what Bioware unfortunately couldn't. This is easily one of the greatest games ever made, and I hope it inspires more excellent RPGs in the future.","Sep 8, 2023",metacritic

"I haven't finished the game yet. But I want to tell this is another masterpiece in storytelling, characters and atmosphere. Gameplay is a bit tricky, but sometimes it's reminding me about my small experience in tactical games. Now I'll proceed to my journey down, down, down by the river. After finishing it for the first time (260 hrs) I can tell this is one of the most long yet best games for sure. I can see how it won GOTY. Well deserved. Great job, Larian! I really looking forward to BG1-2 Remakes and 4th game probably. But it will remain a dream, I suppose. HOPEless to think about it, but hope nontheless.","Nov 24, 2025",steam

"Masterpiece, a new reference in the genre and really unique. If you haven't played party based RPGS or DND and would like to get a sample try this one, it's a blast to play. Story-wise the game is brilliant. You progress story through the main quests but really fill the gaps and expand through sides and exploration. The world is telling you a story of its own, and it's so cool to go out there and discover it. Decisions matter, and they will greatly influence your playthrough. Origin characters are really charismatic and interesting to play with, I loved having them around. The same can be said for lots of the secondary characters. The VAs are amazing, they really live the characters.Graphics and settings/levels are amazing, it is so immersive. The music and sounds are really good too, I hope they had added more voiced tracks like the one in the ""House of Hope"".Building your own custom character while being able to respec easily at any moment is a joy. I really like the mechanics, rests/ spells / equipment etc. It was really cool to build my party over time, unlock abilities, use new equipment and strategies, mastering the party gameplay over time. You build your own strategy and feel it like your own, as well as how you carve your path. Agency feeling is high on this one.I like how chaotic, complex and unpredictable the game can be. If you've played outer wilds, this one also has that feeling of accompiishment when you discover how something works, or how to smartly play an encounter. For the curious and picky, it's wonderful. You will be rewarded for going the extra **** the final mission, I dislike how ally help is implemented. You need to call on them per fight, and waste an action doing so. It is quite discouraging to the point I barely used it. I would have strongly preferred allies to show up along the way as you progress through it if you have that ally available.Inventory management is a bit of a mess, and there are many things that shouldn't be there. Why do I want food in my inventory? It's useless, I just want it to go to camp for me to be able to long rest effectively. Also, I'd like to have more distinctive bags to put stuff in (Scroll bag, weapons bag...). I missed some important mechanics due to the game not telling you about them, like the possibility of going to camp mostly at any time or the idea of sending all food to camp since it is only useless there and it weighs quite a lot making you encumbered often (PS: Karlach is a good mule). I dislike how the game makes you feel a bit too much urgency at first, thorugh cinematics that are kinda encouraging you to take haste even though you can rest as many times as needed. It made my first act more difficult as I was trying not to waste spells. You may skip some cutscenes because you didn't long rest at that precise location too.A tip, don't hesitate to use scrolls, potions, elixirs and such. I had the typical need of hoarding them to be used ""in the future"" and ended up by not using most. Make use of the resources at **** game leaves me with a feeling of mastery of my particular party, but with an urge to try out other combinations and learn about different paths and strategies. Also, can't wait for Steam Workshop support. This game will greatly benefit from modding. Act 3 still has some bugs that need to be addressed and some things were left unfinished (infernal iron?).Looking forward to play this coop at some point, if you are looking for an adventure look no further.","Feb 24, 2024",metacritic

"Great classic RPG. That said, it might not be for everyone. Here are some tidbits that might affect your enjoyment, depending on your tastes and priorities: * Heavy emphasis on RNG: RNG decides a lot of outcomes in this game and can be really frustrating at times. * Turn-based combat: Yeah, it's slow, especially when fighting large groups of enemies. * Movement is very slow: Your group moves rather slowly and you can find yourself looking at your party move somewhere for minutes on end. * You will be reloading A-LOT: The RNG, combined with the limited healing options really forces you to reload frequently. * Plot is very ""Sci-Fi Fantasy"": While D&D is known for its slightly cheesy world, this game leans very heavily into the ""Dark Fantasy & Sci-Fi"" elements of D&D. * Combat can be challenging, but also offers a lot of room for exploits. Given the game's many rules, spells, mechanics and items there are hundreds of ways to cheese and exploit fights if you want to. * Act3 is more disjointed and less polished than Act1 and 2. While the first two Acts offer a clear main objective, Act3's more ""free form"" outcomes are less satisfying as not everything gets a fair conclusion.","Aug 15, 2023",metacritic
"Tl/DR: BG3 is a difficult and time consuming slog-fest. I like some of the characters and the role-playing aspects, but otherwise find the whole thing to be a frustrating experience. I'm past the 50 hour mark and still in ""Act 1"" so maybe things get better, but there's been too many moments in this game that have made for an infuriating experience. Ultimately, I think BG 3 is too difficult for me and I can't figure out what the game wants me to do instead. I have to go online looking up what to do for the majority of the quests and constant roadblocks as it's not intuitive and NONE of it is explained to the player. Getting stuck is a constant. Other players give their ideas about how to cheese the very difficult fights like ""oh, you need to round up explosive barrels and place them where the dude is sitting"", but cheese shouldn't be required to get through the fight. That's poor design. I keep leveling up, getting new weapons, armor, and abilities, but I don't feel like my characters ever truly get stronger. I get pummeled in these fights and when I do win, it's because I was chugging potions the entire time and barely scraping by. The whole game is a slog. It takes a long time to complete a battle (that you might not win and then have to start over) or to loot a room and - like many modern games these days - you're constantly managing a HUGE inventory. It's oddly difficult getting party members outside of your immediate party equipped unless you go back to camp and swap people around. Again, it just slows things down and makes the game feel like a slog. Did you cast a few spells? Cool, now you need to go back to camp. Again. Did you long rest? Ok, now you need to make your way over to the one merchant in the game to see if you can have a few more potions or camp supplies (what happens if you run out of supplies? Are you just soft-locked at that point? I wouldn't put it past this game). I'll lower the difficulty and keep playing because I do enjoy the role playing aspects and some of the less eccentric characters. But I had high hopes for this game due to the glowing reviews and so far have been mostly let down by it. BG 3 is pretty mid at best. Notable moments so far: --Not being able to stealth on a rogue without the enemy immediately seeing you. So what's the point then? --Pulling the entire goblin camp several times over and needing to reload again and again. --Pulling the entire forge camp or whoever those guys are in the underdark forge. --Several other fights in the game where it is 10+ enemies versus your party and I'm at the mercy of how many potions I happen to have left. --Being literally unable to reach or attack an enemy on a high level of the map as he continued to rain down death upon us --Trying to use a forge that took forever to reach only to be attacked by a 300hp level 10 guardian who 1-shot the entire party. --Miss. Miss. Miss. Miss. Miss. Miss. Ooo I hit them the enemy for 4 damage! Miss. Miss. Miss. Miss. --Fights being completely reliant on RNG mechanics so it doesn't matter how many times you level up or what you have equipped. Enemies can and will still stomp you. --Choosing heavy armor for my barbarian because why not, heavy armor sounds cool, only to find out that wearing heavy armor hurts my rage and barbarians don't actually wear heavy armor. Then why give me the option to specialize in it? Why can't I filter out things that are obviously not intended for my character/class?","Mar 23, 2025",steam

"Reaches a point where its no longer subjective this game is objectively one of the best and most ambitious games that have ever come out EVER Pros: -The story is really good and the game is structured in such a way where you can do anything your brain can think of and the story will goes on smooth as butter for example you can just ignore your companions and the game will goes on without a care or you can kill an important character before the story tells you to..well the story will goes on as normal,i dont know how they does it never seen anything like this before -Great cast of characters Astarion,Lae zel and Shadowheart are my favorites because those 3 developed so much in my playthrough that they became unrecognizable compared to the beginning of the game and its all because of me and my choices -the game lets you do ANYTHING you can think of gameplay wise as well... dont have a weapon? you can throw a rock or furniture if you see **** about dropping water to the ground so if you're lucky one of the final boss in game can just slips giving you an advantage( Happened to me) -Visually looks amazing -Insane voice acting performances, in most CRPGs the amount of text you have to read could be daunting but fear not in Baldur's Gate 3 every text,person and even your character's thoughts are voice acted spectacularly Cons: None","Nov 7, 2024",metacritic

"Esse foi o meu primeiro jogo do gênero e eu não sabia exatamente se eu ia gostar. Eu sabia que eu ia gostar da história pelo jeito que todo mundo falava, mas pra mim foi impressionante também o quanto eu gostei da gameplay. Existem inúmeras soluções para qualquer tipo de problema que você encontre, seja ele em combate ou não. Pra mim, isso é perfeito, já que logo após a primeira run eu quero jogar de novo pra testar as coisas de uma maneira diferente. Você pode partir pra porrada, mas o jogo até te recompensa mais às vezes por conseguir o seu objetivo de uma outra maneira. Você decide o que você faz no jogo e como, e eu também gosto que o jogo te dá recompensas muito boas só porque você resolveu falar com um aleatório no meio do caminho sem saber se isso ia dar em briga ou em uma boa história. Tem tanta coisa nesse jogo, mas eu queria falar sobre o trabalho dos dubladores. Eu acho que todo mundo tem seu talento, mas as histórias do Astarion e a da Karlach foram as que me passaram a maior emoção. E com algumas repetições de saves pra escolher coisas diferentes por curiosidade, você pode ver que qualquer escolha que você faz com qualquer companion traz uma atuação INCRÍVEL de qualquer forma. Tudo nesse jogo é incrível pra falar a verdade. Os lugares, as pessoas, as missões, as histórias, as oportunidades. Como eu escrevi em outro lugar, Baldur's Gate 3 pra mim foi uma mesa cheia de pó branco e eu fui o Tony Montana. E acho que vou ser por mais umas 300hrs no mínimo.","Jan 13, 2026",steam

"Between Steam and Xbox I have over 500+ hours. Give it a shot. A fair shot. It took an hour to get going for me, learning the controls, the spells, pretty much everything. OR so I thought it was everything. Think of something you always wanted to do in a game, and you can do it. Want to dual wield Salami and throw it at a goblin mid-fight? The game really lets you play it your way. I was able to get my wife hooked on it. She went from only playing dragon age origins to having 1000hrs on BG3. Voice acting is incredible. The cinematic scenes are epic. The romance truly feels like real connections between the characters. Playing as a Durge turns the game on it's head. Literally feels like an entirely new game. Overall, I can recommend this to the player who likes turn-based combat systems, lots of dialogue options that impact game play, Pillars of Eternity, BG1 & 2, Divinity Original Sin, and a few others I am failing to name. HOWEVER, I can also recommend it to someone who has never played a game of this nature before. It's fresh, exciting, engaging, and made me fall in love with gaming again.

"Baldur’s Gate 3 - A Masterpiece BG3 is a true role-playing game in every sense. Every decision—whether in dialogue, combat, or exploration—has meaningful consequences. Want to betray your allies, side with the villains, or find a morally gray third option? The game lets you do it (Although half the times my morals don't). The sheer number of branching stories is staggering, making each playthrough feel unique and completely different. The turn-based combat, based on Dungeons & Dragons 5e, is extremely deep, complex and rewarding. Positioning, environmental effects (like setting oil on fire, throwing team mates/Gnomes/etc.), and creative spell usage make every encounter feel dynamic. Higher difficulties provide a real challenge, forcing you to think strategically (Sometimes can't just fight your way out of situations...) From the lush forests of the Emerald Grove to the eerie depths of the Underdark, BG3 is visually breathtaking. The facial animations and motion-capture performances set a new standard for immersion in ARPGs. The soundtrack, composed by Borislav Slavov, is absolutely beautiful. Larian has crafted something truly special here—BG3 isn’t just a game; it’s an adventure you’ll remember, with characters you'll hopelessly fall for (Scratch <3)","May 11, 2025",steam

"after being stuck in act 1 for almost two years, i finally finished baldur’s gate 3, and it’s hard not to respect how massive and ambitious this game is. act 2 was easily my favorite part and, honestly, pretty close to perfect. the tone, the pacing, the atmosphere, everything just clicked there in a way the rest of the game doesn’t always manage. most of the companions are really likeable, but karlach, wyll, and shadowheart were on another level for me and stayed in my party basically the entire time. karlach’s story especially hit hard. her arc and its conclusion are genuinely heartbreaking, and it’s easily the one i’ll remember the most. act 3 is where the game starts to lose its footing. the moment you arrive in the city, you can feel the dip in focus and overall quest quality. without spoiling anything, it leans hard into classic rpg nonsense. the game keeps telling you there’s an urgent, city-ending threat, but at the same time it’s perfectly happy letting you spend hours doing side quests like investigating who killed a circus clown. some of these quests are fun, but they completely kill the sense of urgency the story is trying to build. that said, the actual endgame and final stretch do a great job at pulling things back together and delivering a strong payoff. another issue i had is that choice density doesn’t always equal meaningful choice. late in the game you can unlock abilities that make dice rolls almost trivial, even really high ones like 25 or 30. this leads to some pretty weird situations where everyone just instantly believes you and everything goes your way, including outcomes that feel like the developers never really expected most players to reach. it’s cool at first, but it also removes a lot of tension and makes some story moments feel a bit hollow. flaws aside, baldur’s gate 3 is still an incredible achievement. it’s huge, deeply crafted, and full of memorable characters and moments. act 3 may stumble, but the journey as a whole, especially the ending, still makes it something really special.","Jan 20, 2026",steam

While I would've liked to keep more environmentally connected mechanics from Divinity, such as holy- and necrofire etc, BG3 has enough going for it that I rarely miss them in-game. I keep being amazed by how many ways to play there are. I wish I had more time to test everything, especially with friends. After finishing the game, it's really interesting to see how somebody else solves the same and new challenges and how different results one can get. To many more hours with the game.

The graphics, story, and gameplay are all top tier- but I think what really keeps me coming back is that Larian is the first studio to capture the seemingly endless possibilities of DnD in a game. Its not one to one, there's only so far your imagination can be reflected in Baldur's Gate- but I carry around 5 or 6 dead halflings stuffed with explosives to throw at people.

"I did enjoy this game very very much with my husband but I need to be clear. This game is very good especially in this era of gaming. The possibilities are soooo numerous! You can do so many things. If you can think it, there's a huge chance you can do it. Larian Studios has done a phenomenal job! However, it bothers me a great deal that people try to say that this game is better than the original Dragon Age Origins. it is not. DAO was an S tier game throughout the entire campaign. Baldur's Gate 3 falls short. BG3 has 3 parts before the final fight. The 1st part is amazing and the 2nd part is even better (best part of the game IMO). The 3rd part is where the game starts to slow down and just not live up to the gradual build the previous 2 parts had. It's strange because so much is going on due to you being in a major city but it is no where near as satisfying or important as the 1st two parts. It feels like the definition of quantity not quality. It doesn't have anywhere near the umph that the 2nd part has and don't even get me started on the final boss fight. That fight was just no where near as awesome as the final fight in DAO. I only compare the two because, in RPG circles, these two game are heavily compared. DAO is superior in my humble opinion, but please buy Baldur's Gate 3 because I really believe it will be one of the best in the 2020s. It is an amazing, wonderful game. Keep up the great work Larian Studios!","Feb 26, 2025",steam

Don’t really like how so many stuff, even dialogue options, are decided on a dice roll. Wanted to save an innocent character? Too bad, the dice decided they’ll die! That sucks. Not everything that is fun on a tabletop RPG is fun on a videogame that has a limited amount of preprogrammed paths. If that gets too much on your nerves there’s a mod for that btw. But well, it’s a nice game overall. I like the story, the insane amount of different paths you can take, romancing Karlach, lots of side quests and stuff.","Sep 19, 2025",steam

"As a fan of the original games and D&D as a whole, I can not recommend this game and it shakes my faith in Larian to make a game other than Divinity: Original Sin again. Mind Flayers tadpoles do not work in the way that they depicted here. Every companion is woefully under-levelled for their elaborate paint by numbers backstory, and it feels like no research into any of the Forgotten Realms material save for surface level details or story beats from the first two games was ignored for new nonsense. Why is Seravok here, he became a wandering anti-hero after the Bhaalspawn Conflict. Why is Orin a race native to Eberron? The plot is infuriating. I played a solo Dark Urge that killed everyone that hamper progress and the game decided, not me, that I was a loyal Bhaalite despite choosing every option up to that point that stated the contrary and at the end of the game, there is simply no option to win on your own. So if you didn't embrace Illithidism, don't trust the Emperor, and don't want to sell your soul to Raphael, you can go ♥♥♥♥ yourself I guess. I hate this game with every fibre of my being and the only reason I beat is was that I waited 20 for this Critical Role piece of ♥♥♥♥ and felt obligated. Once uninstalled, I will never touch it again. Good riddance.","Feb 10, 2025",steam
"As a long time player and DM of Dungeons and Dragons, This game wonderfully translates D&D to a video game format, while discarding aspects of the table top that would only hinder it. The characters are all distinct and marvelously acted, and though there is plenty of drama in the story, it knows to also feature plenty of silly events, just like any actual game of D&D would.

"It deserves all the praise it gets. Endless amount of customization, player builds, and ability to approach encounters in new ways. I agree with another review I saw that this has that ability to get you thinking about your next playthrough before you even finish your current one. It's a very long game, and I with my attention span for single games I wouldn't have finished the playthrough as quickly as I did if I wasn't playing co-op. I played the whole thing 2 player co-op. I wouldn't want to do more since every player takes away an npc in your party and the NPCs were all so interesting and well written that you want to have them all around. Overall presentation was amazing, visuals, voice acting...etc. The only thing I disagree with is the praise the music gets. I think it's fine, and repetitive too often but still gets the job done.

"So I've just finished watching 40 minutes of credids (if you are the dude thanking themselve for being amazing there, let me push your ego a bit more. Yes, you are, beacuse you are part of the creation of an amazing game) and now I really want to write a review for this overwhelmingly awesome game. Just writing my thoughts down. I got this game recommended by a good friend. She promised me I would love it. So I got it on sale, downloaded it (steam told me it would take 14 Days to finish but someone cured my wifi over night so it was done the next day) and started it. Well let's say I was dissappointed. So much text to understand what my attacks are doing, irritated by the dice system and I hated the movement system. You point, you click, your character moves. I stopped playing the game after 30 hours cause of frustration. But after 3 months or so some other friends started playing the game and told me how awesome it is. So I got curious again, started a new playthrough, took the time for reading what my class is doing, what my spells are doing and what I can achieve with some weapons and armour. And then I started loving the game and it's mechanics. All companions are well written and you get a deep understanding of their intention and wishes over time. Nearly every dialog option you choose changes the game direction and sometimes you have to learn the prize of your chosen dialoge option the hard way. Because this game isn't just about fighting. It's also about talking to your companions (and every single NPC you can find) to get a feeling for the world you're living in. And every single conversation is voiced (Yes Every NPC hase a voiceover). That's so amazing! I really love it because that's a huge reason why you don't loose the motivation talking to some random NPC on the road that 's giving you an unexpected sidequest. Talking about Sidequests. They all feel somehow important. Some bring quite some interesting challenges. (Iron Throne being my favourite, if you know what I mean. If you have no idea, close your browser and stop searching. Don't get spoiled, it's amazing... and frustrating) So I would recommend doing as much sidequests as you can. If you are new to the game or think about buying it (it's woth it's price and I would definetly buy it if I were you) take some time and learn the game mechanics. You will read a lot. Even if it's annoying at the beginning, just do it. There are so many different ways to finish a battle if you know how your abilities work. Feel free to play in easy mode the first time you play. It's mostly more forgiving than other modes (I just have to guess here because I was too stubbern and played normal mode) but prepare for reloading the game many, many times. It's okay, don't feel bad about it. Just try again. I rarely had any bugs. Only some confused enemys climbing a wall 4 times a round or dashing in one direction just to misty step back at their original location. Oh and sometimes my cape was sticking in my torso. My character wasn't screaming in pain so I came to the conclousion that it's just a totally normal thing in this world. I would still not recommend trying to reproduce the Baldurians dresscode. Aaaand that's it. Congratulations for reading through all of this. I wish you an nice day/night/ -put every time of the day in here you want- and of cause a lot of fun playing this amazing game.","Nov 16, 2025",steam

"I went into Baldur's Gate 3 with little, if any, knowledge about games of the genre. TTRPGs or anything derived from them weren't ever as popular in my hometown as they were in the US or elsewhere, but I'd heard a lot of good things about this one in particular and wanted to see what it was about. Frankly, I wasn't disappointed. For starters, the amount of content in this game is, to put it lightly, absolutely insane. Every quest ties in with every other quest, there's continuity between acts (did I mention this has THREE ACTS of gameplay?) and a grand story where every character gets to realize themselves in unique ways. This was, at first, perhaps a bit overwhelming for a new player like me, but, slowly, I grew immersed and started to like the variety of things to do instead of aiming to complete everything in one run, like I hoped I would be able to. (Spoiler: it's impossible to do everything in one go. Who would've guessed?) Secondly, the amount of freedom at hand is baffling. Don't want to fight a boss on their terms? Find a spot where your entire party can pummel them until they die while they can do nothing. Wanna rob the local merchant of all his possessions? Sure, there's like 5 ways to do that. So long as there are spaces on the map to move to and actions you can perform or abilities you can cast, there is nothing stopping you from beating a section of the game in your own creative way. Last, but CERTAINLY not least, the characters. It feels like every living thing in the game has a unique personality, regardless if they're just a street vendor you find in a random spot in the city, or just some NPC in a populated area, or someone whose inclusion in the plot would completely change the outcome of the story. Few characters are actively boring, but, then again, interacting with most NPCs is optional anyway. BG3 is great, I could go on for a while. My only recommendation is to play with friends, seeing as my singleplayer playthrough would've definitely benefitted from that. Other than that, it's really not too hard for me to give this game a solid 10/10 (just wait for the next sale if the full price is too much for you)","Jul 30, 2025",steam

Cutscenes and gameplay can include adult romance, sex, graphic murder and other violence, torture, slavery, abuse and trauma, suicide, theft, wanton destruction of property and environment, animal abuse, criminal organization, profanity, and many other themes that are disturbing to some individuals","Sep 26, 2025",steam
"Best RPG (maybe game) I ever played. Graphics are good, story is good, characters are deep, writing is very very good, acting also, musique is also incredible. Combat system from D&D is also very nicely done, giving a lot possibilities and replaying abilities.","Feb 12, 2025",steam
"Top best CRPG all time, Must play right now. Game Of The Year coming thru . Thanks Larian for this masterpiece","Aug 23, 2023",metacritic
"It's an unforgettable game, and it's definitely worth the hype. Just buy it and try it out! Seriously! Even if you have no knowledge of DnD or experience with turn-based games, it's worth playing. Especially multiple times! It felt like I was constantly learning something new with each playthrough. The story is phenomenal... It's super engaging and immersive. I love the combat, too. I'm a big fan of turn-based RPGs, and BG3 far exceeded my expectations. It made it hard to want to play any other game for a while, lol. I just couldn't stop playing. The characters are so very well-written, and the voice acting is just...wow. So. GOOD. And the music... incredible. Seriously, try it out. Even if you don't like RPGs or turn-based games, or don't know much about DnD, it's so much fun! It's even more fun with friends! And hey, there are mods now! Every playthrough feels fresh and exciting. Here's hoping more RPGs like this one come out, because, for the moment, Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the best to come out in a while.","Dec 01, 2025",steam
Only game that has kept my attention thus far. Love it & keep coming back :),"Mar 02, 2025",steam
"I could probably write an entire essay about why I love the game, but I'll try to keep it short. The game shines with its huge, explorable world, its story with varied paths through seemingly endless conversation options, and a small element of chance: the dice roll. Depending on what you roll and which skills you've leveled, you can be lucky or unlucky in combat or in conversation options. An element you either love or hate (usually both). I also love the various companions you can add to your party through exploration throughout the story. With their distinct personalities and their stories, supported by top-notch voice actors, the characters feel truly real. Depending on your interactions, other characters can form a relationship with you or leave the party forever. No matter which path you ultimately choose, the game offers a journey you'll never forget. After two years, I'm already on my third save and I'm still seeing scenes I've never seen before. The new multiplayer and crossplay feature is also a lot of fun and a very nice addition. This game has deservedly become Game of the Year 2023, and I'm excited to see what other exciting projects Larian Studios will develop. All I can say is that the game is fantastic and will always hold a place in my heart.","Aug 07, 2025",steam
"A different feel than classic BG but with great post launch support, excellent visuals and huge replayability it's difficult not to recommend this game. The tone is darker than even BG2 in my personal experience so I find it harder to replay but overall it does a good job representing Larian's vision of D&D.","Aug 27, 2025",steam

"A rare example of a game that can never really be overhyped, this game lived up to and surpassed any and all expectations I had. Baldur's Gate 3 really is the new pinnacle of gaming, and has set the bar for everything that comes after. The sheer amount of choice, endings, and branching stories alone is more than I could ever ask for. And it is accompanied with some of the most satisfying combat and classes I have ever enjoyed. Every playthrough of mine has been drastically different, and I still don't think I've uncovered remotely everything there is to see. This is one of those games I'll keep happily coming back to whenever the Urge beckons ;)","Jan 19, 2026",steam
"I think it's impossible not to love Baldur’s Gate. The level of detail, the depth of the characters, and the amount of freedom you're given make it an unforgettable experience. In my opinion, this game sets a new benchmark for every RPG going forward—it's a masterclass in storytelling, world-building, and player choice","Apr 16, 2025",steam
"Oh, I absolutely love BG3. I discovered it a year ago after it won its awards and, surprisingly, I had barely seen any content about it beforehand. I got it as a birthday gift, wasn’t really into turn-based combat, and knew absolutely nothing about D&D-style games. And wow… what a pleasant surprise. There’s honestly nothing I dislike about this game. The music is incredible, the story is gripping, the characters are memorable, and the sheer amount of choices you have is insane. The replayability is huge, and every decision actually feels meaningful. And the fights… oh my god, the fights. Deep, tactical, rewarding, and genuinely fun once you get the hang of **** took me one solid run to fully understand the mechanics and how everything works, but that’s what makes future runs even better. You start experimenting, taking risks, building differently, and it just keeps getting more satisfying. This game completely changed my perception of turn-based RPGs. Huge fan, and honestly, one of the best gaming experiences I’ve had in a long time.","Dec 23, 2025",metacritic
"Product received for free It could be a great game with more polish, in the late game all the negative aspects pile up and playing becomes unpleasant. + act I is well done + graphics + detailed world building with attention to details and even special voicelines for small things + a lot of content even though it's rushed/badly done in many places 1. Illusion of choice. The game presents itself as giving many choices but this is not true. Many decisions lead to the same result, many times the game decides for you. 2. Dice rolls are rigged. In certain moments to roll a 15 dice with proficiency and modifiers is harder than to roll a 25 in casual gameplay, even if you reroll with inspirations. For that reason you would want to quicksave and reload to achieve the desired result, thus making it actually YOUR choice. 3. If you don't play Drow you just lose game content because Drows get a special treatment 4. Utility/control spells are mostly useless. In 90% of cases only useful on large amounts of weak enemies and even then not guaranteed to work on most enemies. 5. This forces you to just always build into damage, it is simply easier and more efficient. You would rather do all actions into bursts of damage than waste them on anything else. In some moments you can only win if you have initiative, and if you wasted it on a failed CC spell you lose as the enemies quickly kill you. 6. There are only few useful classes (read as: damage classes), Shadowheart unironically works best as a sorcerer. As original class she misses most of her spells even in the late game. 7. In some areas you cannot go to long rest (which makes sense) but fights can be many and last for too long. If you waste important spells on first several fights then you approach the boss of the area naked with only melee damage and a few cantrips. Not good. The game forces you to save your resources and use your power carefully. But on your first playthrough you never know where to save and where to spend, so this results in you preserving valuable resources until the end of the game without the joy of using them. There is angelic slumber potion but it is rare and limited. 8. You can just buff your main character to oblivion and there is no incentive to utilize different characters in the game for different tasks. You can still do it but buffing your character is just simpler and easier. 9. Illithid powers suck, there is nothing about them that makes me want to contemplate taking them. I would consider them if they gave a free spell slot or allowed to cast fireballs for free. Only reactions are somewhat good, but even things like blast are too weak (barely 8 damage to a 100HP enemy when they cast a spell) 10. The game, not just characters but the game itself forces you to abandon your humanity in favor of said powers that suck. Even moreso, the game implies you have used these powers even if you didn't. 11. For some reason most male characters in the camp instantly want to jump onto you, you have to cringe and decline their ""requests"". - meanwhile Shadowheart takes a sh*tton of effort to even get kissed. Neither Minthara nor Karlach jump onto you right off the bat. But male characters do. And Lazael (literally a frog). Interesting. 12. Astarion: great acting, completely useless to the plot line and is a net negative to positive plays with his constant disagreeing and whining. The game wants to make you think that deep down he is a good person and he is only evil because he was tortured for hundreds of years or something. This is not how it works. Good people don't need convincing to be good no matters what horrible events happened to them. They may mistrust you, they may see everyone around as a threat, but if they are good, they remain good. Astarion is just an a*shole. 13. Bugs. Bugged gamepad UI. Voicelines get mixed together. Can't cast certain spells from a gamepad because subvariant selection wheel does not appear. Wyll talks to me like I have to save his father while his already saved father stands right next to him. Misleading quest markers. Spells like fog disappear after being cast. Many such things. - Especially bugged gamepad UI. Often you have to reopen the wheel 2 times for selection to work, telekinesis selection is bugged and broken, sometimes you have to reopen inventory a bunch of times for navigation to start working properly. Very annoying. 14. Baldurs Gate is presented as suffering from food shortage (this is important) and of course the guys who put themselves (native citizens) over refugees are painted in a bad light. I guess developers of this game did not learn about Leningrad blockade. When there is no food citizens start to eat each other. If you invite even more refugees to a city like this, refugees become the food. But the game pushes that suicidally empathic point of view on the player because developers apparently think that food manifests itself out of thin air, and said native citizens are just evil hoarders who do not want to share their abundance. 15. Long rest mechanic is cumbersome and deliberately time wasting. 16. A hefty amount of certain propaganda pushed on the player. There is a clear moral obligation for the player to make certain choices otherwise the player will be punished in one way or another. 17. Many nonsensical quests like the one with the dragon. Even the puzzles and the ""poetry"" are nonsense, the quest was clearly rushed. No choice to talk your way out of being enemies either. 18. ""Bad"" choices are always punished - you lose game content. Instead of having something else happen to you, nothing happens to you instead, and you just never unlock content that is available with a ""good"" choice.","Oct 29, 2025",steam

"Although I've been a long time DnD fan, since it began in the 70's, I have not really played much since my teens, with the last real playtime landing with the ""Gold"" box (Pool of Radiance, Curse of the Azure Bonds, etc.) games and finally Baldur's Gate 1 & 2 upon their initial release. I bought into this a couple of years back but only put a couple of hours in and found I didn't want to ruin the surprise. So much to learn and find in this game! This game deserves an 20 out of 10. Larian devs put so much effort into this game and every time I think I have cleared an area, I go back to find more that I have missed. Wander EVERYWHERE. Go to dead ends. Open everything. All this exploration is on top of the amazingly well spoken and written story lines. I want to play with every character. If you are the type of person that might be interested in the story, quests, exploration, and are not turned off by redoing battles, if needed, then PLAY it. It is the best game of its type to EVER be developed for computers/console - I'm not kidding. It is the top of pile by a huge margin and that's for the last FIFTY (50) years of Dnd. This is a GOD tier Dungeons and Dragons Game.","Aug 19, 2023",metacritic
I recently bought/downloaded BG3 after purchasing my gaming laptop. I have had friends recommend this as I really enjoy DnD.

"I remember playing through Act 1 in early access a week before launch Summer 2023. It was fun and intriguing enough but I wasn't super eager to return to it due to other life commitments. When I got around to finishing a full playthrough, though, I thought it was just fine. If you grew up playing CRPG's—especially ones from Bioware, the story feels like a long sequence of highs from those games. It gets exhausting real quick; there's just too much spectacle. It feels hollow, somehow? Almost like I'm reading a YA novel. In-game, I couldn't escape the feeling that I've done all of this before. In my early access playthrough I played as a Tiefling Paladin Oathbreaker. In my full run I changed to Half-Orc, same class but with 'The Dark Urge' origin selected. The difference in race-specific talk options between these two is night and day. The difference between Durge and non-Durge options even more-so. I can't imagine getting through all three Acts as a non-Durge player character. It would end up being more of a slog than it already is. You're supposed to bide your time with the companion quests but they're so unevenly fleshed out I could feel myself growing impatient by the end of Act 2. Each Act has its own main map. Act 1 is massive with a lot of cleverly-designed levels. At times, the sheer amount of interconnectedness feels unending (in a good way). Problems arise when the game restricts you to certain paths as a way of transitioning into the next Act. For example: It seems like I should be able to reach the Gauntlet of Shar from the Grymforge, but no, you to go through nearly all of Act 2 instead. The game never returns to the mystery that made Act 1 so appealing, and once you reach the city in Act 3, you just want it to be over with. I had more fun with Divinity: Original Sin 2.","Jun 17, 2025",steam

The main characters you interact with have such like obnoxiously detailed stories and arcs, it's amazing.

"Just finished a 100-hour playthrough, and I find myself with no one to share my thoughts with, as I have been alone for the past few years. So, consider this a confession — a pouring out of my soul in the hope that it might reach someone who understands what this game made me feel. This is the greatest game I have ever played. I cannot predict whether it will hold that title forever — life is unpredictable — but I can speak for what I have experienced so far. Baldur’s Gate 3 is a masterpiece, a beacon of light in the shadow of everything else I have encountered lately. There is so much I want to say about it. So many things touched the deepest parts of my soul, from its minor mechanics, exploits, and builds to the brilliance of its dice-based gameplay and more. And then there’s the story — one of the most beautiful I have ever experienced, brought to life by an array of vivid characters and unforgettable scenes. When I finished the game, I had only about 30 minutes to watch the final cutscene because the war-torn country I live in suffers from frequent power outages, and I knew I had to see how it all ended. I could not bear to leave the story unfinished. That moment, when everything culminated in Astarion’s simple words, ""See you later, darling,"" at the camp, struck me profoundly. In my life, I have never had friendships like the ones I formed in this game, and I really did not want to say goodbye to them. I know it is just a game. I know I can replay it and explore new outcomes. But this feeling, this powerful ache in my heart, will never be the same. With the deepest gratitude, I want to thank every person who contributed to creating this extraordinary work of art. I fell in love with this game — every single part of it. The quests, dialogues, intrigue, family bonds, betrayals, choices, the seamless flow of the story from beginning to end, the consequences, and yes, even the romance. (Shadowheart, you were incredible, but Karlach… she stole my heart in the end). Every aspect captivated me completely. I do not know how much time I have left on this Earth, nor what lies ahead in my own story. But I know this: this game was a lifeline during one of the darkest, most chaotic times in my life. Amid war, death, and corruption, it reached out to me, pulled me from the abyss and reminded me that there is always something worth fighting for. It taught me that giving up is never an option — no matter what the dice say — and that the best is yet to come. Right now, I feel full. I feel at peace. This game deserves every bit of its 10/10 rating, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone and everyone. With the warmest regards, D","Dec 05, 2024",steam

"The world and story are immense, if you like to run multiple times this game is excellent for that, lots of paths through the game. The combat is fun (not arpg but fun crpg :)), especially being able to add in trick shots and like here and there like blowing up oil beside a mob. A lot of dialog and story with many personalities that you see more than once. You can skip through dialog quickly if you don't care to read it all or just want to run through an area a few times to try out different options. Many decisions along the way, most shape the story in a meaningful way within each act, although the transition to the next act narrows to ensure you get there. Lots of narration, immersive. Fights vary a lot in difficulty, can't always tell when you are going to win easily or get trounced! Late to the review party, but this is just and excellent game.","Jan 06, 2025",steam

There are others but that is the big one in my experience. There are countless reasons it's great as well. The races, classes, and sub-classes are wonderful and that's not even mentioning the customization you can past that. The characters feel so real and it seems there's almost infinite possibilities of ways you can manipulate situations and battles in your favor.

"The game is not perfect. The gameplay can be clunky and punishing for the wrong reasons (e.g., I click ""hide all"", but somehow, one jackass on my team manages to UNhide himself and my cover is blown). But, for every one of those instances, there are 3 in which I noticed some brilliant little design detail (e.g. when all character inventories are open, you can sort all the inventories at once, or each individually, with a single click). And as far as the writing and story, you really can't get much better. Even the random letter on a dead body, if you bother to read it, is beautifully written and crafted with love.

"Game is very fun to play. You can lose yourself in the game with everything that occurs. Playing it more than once, you can still find new things to find and meet new people each time.

"Unpopular opinion time. I didn't like Divinity either, so this being a stinker isn't really that much of a shock. 6 hours in and the combat is still a badly unbalanced railroad. Give the illusion of free choice and exploration, but fail to do the precise order of quests that you MUST and you will crash into impossible odds. Cause and effect are nonsensical; seeing the druid camp explode into an everyone versus everyone riot is beyond illogical. I have zero investment in the party characters, with them all being so fundamentally dislikeable. The idea that 1st level characters have deeply rooted ties to great powers makes no sense either. Combat is decidedly uninteresting as a melee character, which leans the game into being a bard/mage playthrough as not only the default but pretty much mandatory option. Puerile writing, graphics and animation might interest some, but do nothing for the plot or believability of the characters here. Skill checks that if you don't have your character build and party exactly right, at the right time that cannot be adapted to (e.g. the necessary fight by the guardian statues in the Druid Camp). Tiny nods to the legendary BG1, 2 games are welcome; but offer little solace for a game that just isn't terribly much fun to play. I keep trying to come back to this for the sake of playing out the story, but I'd probably be better served by just watching a playthrough on youtube. A shame, given the rave reviews and following this title has. But I just don't like Larian's style. Maybe other developers will get inspired to do something in this space again?","Jan 24, 2026",steam

"Product received for free [Gift from a friend] I really want to like this game - I want to understand why it's heralded as the second coming of Christ by the gaming community at large. But it's just not clicking for me, even after 60 hours so you can't say I didn't really try to get into it. I'm legitimately frustrated that I'm not finding the joy that so many other people are getting from this; I feel like I'm missing something. First, the negatives: I find combat to be clunky and unintuitive, and generally the same can be said for the UI and interacting with the world. Combat is an absolute slog and easily the worst part of the game. Of course, being shackled to D&D's abysmal magic system also does the game no favors either. Character creation, much like the source material, is a convoluted mess from a gameplay perspective, though props to Larian for adapting so much variation into a single game here. The main narrative felt like it was dragging so much, with side quests offering such basic fantasy tropes as ""the evil witch is evil! Oh no!"" or ""these goblins are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, watch out!"" The world-building and combat both felt like Larian expected players to already be familiar with D&D lore and rules, and if you're not well that's just too bad. I felt like I kept returning to the game out of obligation, not curiousity. There's only so many times you can suggest a possible solution to the main mystery only to shout ""PSYCH!"" to the player before I start getting Lost flashbacks... On the positive side, the game looks beautiful when it's not suffering from distracting pop-in. It mostly runs well and must not be in Unreal Engine because I don't think it ever crashed on me or decided to stutter because the wind blew west for a second. Character models are some of the best I've seen in recent years and the art direction hits a perfect balance between realistic and stylized. It mostly looks real, but it's not afraid to indulge in the weirder or more colorful parts of D&D lore. Dialogue options are also a great time to play with, especially when trying to use your character's specialties and abilities. The party characters are very memorable and likeable, even the intentionally unlikeable ones. And generally the music is good, even if I may have some light PTSD from hearing that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat music. I don't know. I feel like I did playing The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD - there's clearly something of quality here, but there's an ungracefulness in its overall presentation that's hurting my enjoyment. Like that game, I may put this on a list of games to potentially revisit in the distant future to try again and see if they click with an older, changed version of myself. But for now...this feels like a criminally overrated experience.","Sep 27, 2025",steam

"The sheer amount of content this game has in insane, the quality of all conversations, the optimizing needs a little work, but it's a million times better than many other games which is crazy to think about. I have played this game for 146 hours at the times of this review and I have barely scratched the surface of the game, although it is true that I have deleted some of my characters with much time invested because I changed my mind about their looks. Still tho, I have played enough to understand it's quality, it is incredibly good, I wouldn't say perfect but certainly close to a perfect CRPG. I played Divinity Original Sin 2 for many MANY hours, it is quite similar to Baldur's Gate 3, but every character has been massively improved in this game. Certainly a GOTY","Aug 16, 2023",metacritic

"Finally a developer that understands what players want in a RPG as this gives unmatched variety/depth/freedom in it's gameplay. I hired a Female Dwarf Barbarian who has some cool perk where she gets stronger with LESS armor/clothing on... so the game let me take everything off including underwear and she now charges into battle bare naked with just a Axe and boots on and she is easily my strongest character. I didn't think I was going to like the slower turn based combat coming from games like Diablo 4 and Remnant 2. To compare, those games feel like babies first RPG compared to the options and depth in this combat. Not only are you controlling a party of 4 but they all have their own skills/gear/personalities. And the loot system is amazing as well as 1 chest in some random ladies house you ransacked will have amazing boots for that naked dwarf barb I mentioned earlier. I wasn't expecting to get this game but I had to jump on board once I saw the numbers on Steam and I am so glad I did as this is easily one of the best RPG's ever made. Even if you don't like turn based combat/tactical RPG's I would still buy it just for the amazing possibilities the game allows you to explore that many games lack.","Aug 6, 2023",metacritic

"Baldur's Gate 3 is a real masterpiece unlike other games like Diablo IV. The game has all the QoL features that Diablo IV can't offer. Better story and better narrator overall than Diablo IV. Large selection of items, with well thought out enchantments. Not like the junk from Diablo IV. Builds can be designed however you want. You can have several skills and different elixirs, potions, crafting etc. Like Witcher 3 Different monsters/races/characters Very good cut scenes All characters have a story to tell or interact with in the story. Not like that soulless diablo game where you have 75x Blacksmiths just slapped along with copy + paste. You can go in different directions in the game and have different decisions, therefore different endings of the story. You can see when developers make an effort what a divine game the result is. I could say more positive things about Baldur's Gate 3, but that's enough for now. I recommend Baldurs Gate3 to everyone who also likes turn-based games (DnD) But for now, the game gets a 10/10. Excellent work, Larian !!!! Note: Fk you Blizzard Company, check out Larians game how to do it right !","Aug 19, 2023",metacritic

The restarts aren't because of any game breaking bug but because there is so much to see, so much replayability, that I couldn't get through a single save without being sidetracked by another character idea or playstyle. This game has defined the gold standard for RPGs in my opinion, sitting at the same table as classic RPGs like Mass Effect and Fallout New Vegas and even surpassing them. Gameplay variety and depth, character progression and emotional storylines, dialogue options and roleplay potential, all of it. Any RPG coming out now, isometric or otherwise, will have to compete with the absolute powerhouse that is Baldur's Gate 3.","Jul 22, 2025",steam

"This game is the best game i have ever played in my mind, like i can get it off of my mind. At first, i didnt thought of anything good about this game i thought it was going to be a boring ass game with dnd and stuff but boy am i wrong, every thing in this game scream masterpiece, the narrative (hell they got J.K simmons the guy who plays homelander, Terence Fletcher from whiplash and John jonah jameson from spiderman) bro i can yap all i want for the narrative but like every romance or every story that are convey in this video game is art, is like the game is telling me a poem or a great story or adventure that we are a part of 10/10, but not only that the romance is peak, when i heard where this game has like a lot of sex scenes i thought this was going to be bad romance and a bunch of gooner and oh boy i was wrong, when i romance shadowheart in the game oh boy the character development was peak she was from an annoying and a secretive shar worshiper to someone really sweet, i didnt know i would care alot for an ingame character's approval which also adds up to why the game is sooo ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good. like i have the mind of a gold fish usually i wouldn't care about storys in game but this game i can watch the dialogue for hours and hours and i wouldn't get bored hell i fell a sleep when i was reading or watching genshin/ honkai' dialogue.now for gameplay, the game gives you freedom to do, yes it is a turn based and can be boring but the options of what you can do in this game what makes it boring hell might as well make the hell more of a fun, like at first i thought this game was going to be a snoore fest with the gameplay oh boy it wasn't like ♥♥♥♥ i was satying a wake for each fight like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ was soo goood. in conclusion, this game really deserve the game awards at first i didnt know why cuz i was a legend of zelda glazer, but since playing this game legend of zelda seems much more smaller compare to this game. even though i was late in this action, i would suggest everyone who havent touch or are scared to try out baldur's gate to try it , i swear it is really addictive and you can play hoursupon hours with your friend, hell me and my friend kept playing this game til 3 or 4 am in the morning its that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good 10/10 recommend to new players","Dec 08, 2024",steam

"This game is a masterpiece of a era where good Rpg are not very common. Single player campaign, very long with endless possibilities and a quality that will blow your mind. Now, game is not perfect. Sometimes it gest ""too modern"" (you know where I mean) but it s never in our face or a constant. Act III is not of the same super quality tan act I and II. I enjoyed it but I can see some of the complaints being valid. The reason I m giving this game a 9 and not a 10 is for the weak companions relationship. I was expecting something like Mass Effect but it s very shallow and sometimes personal moments feels very cheap. Other than that is one of the best videogames I played in years. It will take you back to one time where games where fun and they were complete at launch. THe production of this game is amazing. The music, the actors and the writing is superb. Please you give it a try.","Aug 20, 2023",metacritic

Be prepared to be engrossed in a narrative for hours on end - and for it to only feel like minutes.

It took me forever to finish but there a few games that bring me to tears at such a great ending to a terrific game. I remember buying this day 1 on early access and just watching the game grow and shape into the masterpiece it is today. I went into this as a sorcerer on tactician mode and it was rough but I hope to do an honor mode run eventually. My favorite party member in this game was everyone! Everyone was just so great and awesome and I don't know what else to say lol. Anyways 10 out of 10. Larian studios you should be proud!,"Dec 24, 2024",steam

"I’ve put about 146 hours into Baldur’s Gate 3, and it was my first real dice-based RPG. It ended up being one of the most rewarding games I’ve played in years. The amount of choice and reactivity is impressive. Your decisions actually matter, both in dialogue and in combat, and there are countless ways to approach the same situation depending on your party, skills, and creativity. It makes every playthrough feel personal instead of scripted. The story, characters, and world are all extremely well done, and the turn-based combat has enough depth to stay interesting even deep into the game. If you enjoy story-driven RPGs with meaningful choices and tactical combat, this is an easy recommendation.","Jan 25, 2026",steam
"An open world RPG that actually understands the assignment. Plenty of side quests, a main quest that can be coherently followed with room to wander, and life breathed into every little element. 10/10.","May 07, 2025",steam
"After 23+ years of playing games, I think I finally have an answer to what my favorite game of all time is: - Unbelievable voice acting and facial animations during dialogue. The writing is incredible. The characters are so likeable, from main questline characters to a random cow on the side of the road. I have the attention span ****, but not 1 conversation in this game has lost my attention for more than 5 seconds. - Your choices matter, and not in the Tod Howard sort of way. The game totally changes depending on your choices of which there are countless. It makes you want to play through the entire game multiple times just to experience how different each playthrough is. - Tactical, turn-based combat with so many different ways to approach any given encounter. The difficulty can vary drastically depending on your plan going into a fight, and there is a massive amount of freedom in how you choose to exploit an enemies weaknesses if you are willing to look for them. - The character creation and class system is deep, and only becomes deeper as you level up and unlock more skills and traits for your characters. Each class can showcase it's own utility in all things including combat, world traversal and dialogue. Every character in your party will have their uses depending on the situation. - The story is phenomenal from start to finish. It initially makes you feel somewhat insignificant as an entity in a massive world with so much going on around you, yet also makes your decisions for you and your party feel important and impactful to the world you inhabit. There are twists you don't expect, as well as tough decisions to make that can drastically change your playthrough. And the game is paced beautifully as it slowly builds and builds in tension and intrigue. Overall this game is probably the most shockingly good game I've ever played. I haven't tried any of the previous instalments in the series, and I had hardly heard of it up until it released this month. But it has ended up, in my mind, being a must-win for game of the Year, even in a year with so many great games being released. This is a special piece of media made by people that clearly truly care about what they have made and they deserve all the success they are having for it.","Aug 24, 2023",metacritic
"I LOVE Larian since Divinity and THIS is far beyond my expectation! Over the moooooooooooon I always dreamed to play D&D since I was a kid, but there is none to be found in Thailand then. So the first time I knew that Larian was about to dev D&D game under Baldur's Gate franchise, I had sooo high expectation on this game. And as I said, this is totally far beyond what I hoped for. Re-playings are extremely enjoyable + They are still developing it! I do love Larian and their team. Even searched to see how they work and their office tour. Really really love their souls. I pray for the team and their family with eternal blessing. You guys have given hope to us, as a business, as a game studio, as an artist, and as a human. Best wishes 🙂","Dec 21, 2024",steam

"The combat and the general systems interplay is genuinely fantastic, however, this is an RPG and it's just terribly written. Act 3 functionally isn't worth playing and it's clear that there's a large amount of cut content. I didn't particularly care for the companions, the villains are kind of pants on head stupid if you take a moment to think about it and overall the conclusion is just not there. You've heard of the game. Buy it on sale because only half the story is worth playing. Enjoyable just poorly concluded.","Nov 23, 2025",steam

Solo play or multiplayer, it doesn't matter, you will have a great time. The story is engaging, the characters are unique and memorable, and I find myself coming back to this game time and time again. Just one more playthrough!","Nov 04, 2025",steam
"English version : Everything about this game is great : the story, the gameplay, the variety of builds, the characters, the music or the huge range of choices. Playing solo lets you really appreciate the quality of the characters (they’re very well-written), but it’s just as fun to play online with others, like a D&D campaign. Either way, the game is so vast that no two sessions are alike, so you could always do both ! For completionists, you’ll need to replay the game multiple times, and the Honor mode is pretty tricky. But if you choose your battles wisely and pay attention, you’ll get strong enough to finish the game, just don’t take unnecessary risks ! There are always simple ways to gain experience. Other than that, the rest is mainly about discovering the different endings, which is pretty fun. The game is expensive, but it's totally justified. The developers have also added a lot of new content for free after release, so give them some support ! :-) French version : Jeu incroyable, que ça soit au niveau de l'histoire, du gameplay, de la variété de builds, des personnages, de la musique ou de l'énorme variété de choix possibles. Y jouer en solo permet d'apprécier la qualité des personnages (qui sont vraiment bien écrits), mais c'est tout aussi drôle d'y jouer à plusieurs en ligne comme une campagne D&D. De toute façons, le jeu est tellement vaste que les parties ne se ressemblent jamais, alors vous pouvez toujours faire les deux ! Pour les complétistes, il faudra refaire le jeu plusieurs fois, et le mode Honneur est assez tordu, mais si vous choisissez bien vos combats et que vous faites attention, vous deviendrez assez fort pour finir le jeu, mais ne prenez jamais de risques si ce n'est pas nécessaire ! Il y a toujours des moyens simples de gagner de l'expérience. Sinon, le reste se limite au fait de découvrir les différentes fins, donc c'est plutôt sympa. Le jeu est cher, mais il mérite complètement son prix, avec des développeurs qui ont d'ailleurs rajouté beaucoup de nouveau contenu totalement gratuitement après la sortie du jeu, alors donnez-leur un coup de pouce :-)","Oct 14, 2025",steam
"Everytime I try and play another top down rpg, it just reminds me how much better pillar of eternity is than the game. I'm playing. Combat in this game is like a 2 out of 10. Can't really even get far into the game because I just die over and over. I end up save scumming the whole time. The theme is really lame and gross. The characters are lame and have overly dramatic and childish (theater kid like) backgrounds. Just overall missing good fantasy vibes. Feel more like a ridiculous story line made up by dnd nerds than an epic fantasy. Idk maybe Ill come back to it but more than likely Ill just play PoE 1 again.","Dec 01, 2025",steam

"Baldur’s Gate 3: A Masterpiece That Truly Deserved Game of the Year Let me just say this upfront: Baldur’s Gate 3 isn’t just a game—it’s an experience. From the moment you start your journey, you realize you’re stepping into something special, something crafted with an insane level of care and detail. It’s the kind of game that grabs you and doesn’t let go, and it 100% deserved Game of the Year. First off, the freedom this game gives you is unparalleled. You can approach almost any situation in so many ways—talk your way out, fight your way through, or use the environment to outsmart your enemies. The sheer amount of choice is mind-blowing. Want to play as a sneaky rogue who talks circles around everyone? Go for it. Maybe you’d rather be a wild magic sorcerer who occasionally sets themselves on fire by accident—it’s all possible. And the choices aren’t just limited to combat. Your dialogue, actions, and even the people you travel with all shape the story in meaningful ways. The story itself is phenomenal. It’s deep, emotional, and filled with twists that keep you hooked. Every character you meet feels like they have their own life and motivations. Your party members, especially, are just fantastic. From the snarky Astarion to the noble Shadowheart, everyone has layers to uncover. And the way your relationships evolve with them based on your decisions? Chef’s kiss. You’re not just playing through a pre-written story—you’re crafting your own epic. Now let’s talk about the gameplay. The combat is turn-based, which I’ll admit I was unsure about at first. But wow, it’s so much fun. Every battle feels like a puzzle to solve, and when you land a big combo or pull off a clever move using the environment, it’s insanely satisfying. Even outside of combat, the game encourages creativity. Spells and abilities aren’t just for fighting—you can use them to solve puzzles, bypass obstacles, or even just mess around. It makes you feel like you’re truly inhabiting a living, breathing world. Another reason Baldur’s Gate 3 is so much fun is the co-op. Playing this with friends is a blast. You’ll find yourselves laughing over ridiculous decisions, debating over moral choices, or just reveling in the chaos someone’s wild plan inevitably creates. It’s the kind of game that creates stories you’ll be talking about for years. The visuals and voice acting deserve a shoutout too. The environments are gorgeous, with so much attention to detail that every location feels unique and immersive. And the voice acting? Top-notch. The performances bring every character to life and make the emotional moments hit even harder. Finally, it’s worth mentioning just how polished this game is. It’s a rarity these days to play a game that feels so complete at launch. Baldur’s Gate 3 set a new standard for what RPGs should be. In the end, Baldur’s Gate 3 isn’t just fun—it’s an achievement. It’s the kind of game that reminds you why you love gaming in the first place. Whether you’re here for the story, the gameplay, or just to see how wild your decisions can get, it delivers on every front. This is what Game of the Year looks like.","Dec 26, 2024",steam

"Baldurs Gate 3 really is a MASTER CLASS in character development and story writing. I, and many others, am enamored with its beauty. The way they treat their players is really something else, so much is given to us, and they do their best not to nickel and dime the player base to death.

"Really interesting, cool game that I tried to refund twice Because of the locked camera view and resource system that required long resting to regain skills and abilities (I hate that mechanic, i understand it's for story progress, but still i disliked it so much that I ended up using a mod, which I'll mention below) However, Steam refused my refund request and honestly, thank you Steam Support for that! After 2-3 hours of playing this game, I downloaded the Native Camera Tweaks and Regeneration mod, and I finally understood why people enjoy this game so much The story and combat are so great that it just absorbed me, everything felt so fun and i was curious about everything, companions, the main story, the side quests, i almost did all side quests in Act 1,2, rushed on Act 3 tho because i felt overpowered, was ready to whoop big brain ass, the only game that made feel like this was Witcher 3 with all DLCs included, so yeah, the game is awesome The endings are a bit meh though, especially the evil ones, they feel dull, and I expected more from them But overall, it's a cool game that I can recommend","Oct 29, 2025",steam

"I’ve always loved RPGs but I never thought a CRPG grounded in tabletop DNA would land this hard for me. Baldur’s Gate 3 didn’t just meet my expectations for character-driven storytelling and decision-making, it redefined them. Compared to narrative titans like Mass Effect, KOTOR, Fallout, or Elder Scrolls, this game doesn’t just stand beside them, it looks them in the eye. Your choices in BG3 feel deeply personal, not just in dialogue but in action, consequence, and the relationships that grow (or shatter) because of them. You explore at your own pace, and that freedom is powerful but also dangerous. The game won’t stop you from making a reckless decision, and it certainly won’t stop a dragon-riding Githyanki from reminding you why that was a mistake. There’s a quiet respect in how the game trusts you to find your own way, even when it leads to disaster. There were moments I laughed out loud, sat back in awe, or felt genuine tension about a decision. And all of it was driven by my own choices, not scripted “gotchas,” but the natural result of living in a world that responds (although not powerful enough to overcome my save scumming). If you’re a fan of RPGs and haven’t tried this yet, you owe it to yourself. And if you’re unsure about the CRPG format? I was too. This game changed that.","Jun 23, 2025",steam

"💌 Score: 10/10 👍🏻 Pros ✔️ Consequential choices that reshape the world and story ✔️ Deep, evolving companion relationships ✔️ Gorgeous, detailed visuals and dynamic lighting ✔️ Tactically rich turn-based combat ✔️ Outstanding voice work and epic soundtrack 👎🏻 Cons ❌ A few companions (Wyll, Halsin) could use more dedicated content ❌ Occasional performance dips in densely populated areas ❌ Long load times between certain zones 🌦️ Introduction Baldur’s Gate 3 rightly earned its GOTY 2023 crown. Every decision—big or small—ripples through the world, making each playthrough uniquely personal. The real magic, however, lies in its cast of companions—each character grows richer the more time you spend with them. The game’s Unreal Engine 4-powered graphics bring Faerûn to life with stunning detail. From the flicker of torchlight in shadowy dungeons to the lush canopies of the Emerald Grove, environments feel both vibrant and immersive. Character models and spell effects pop with cinematic flair, making every cutscene and encounter a visual treat. Larian Studios’ turn-based adaptation of D&D 5th Edition shines here. Combat is tactical and satisfying, with terrain, cover, and status effects all playing critical roles. Outside of battle, the freedom to explore, experiment with spells, and combine environmental elements (like igniting oil slicks) makes every approach uniquely yours. The interface can be dense at first, but it rewards patient players with limitless creative possibilities. At its heart, Baldur’s Gate 3 is driven by the weight of choices and the bonds you form. Decisions can steer the story toward salvation or disaster, with your companions’ arcs evolving in tandem—whether it’s Shadowheart’s journey toward redemption, Karlach’s fierce but loyal spirit, Gale’s precarious charm, or Astarion’s biting wit. Even characters like Minthara and the returning Jaheira leave a strong impression when they enter your story. Minsc, another beloved figure from the original games, adds a nostalgic yet heartfelt energy to the party with his unwavering heroism and hilarious quips. Though I initially found Lae’zel difficult to connect with, her development made me grow to respect her. Wyll and Halsin have standout moments too, though I wish their stories were explored in more depth. The soundtrack swells with epic orchestral themes that underscore major story beats, while subtler motifs highlight quieter moments of reflection. Voice acting across the board is superb—each companion’s tone matches their personality perfectly, from Minsc’s boisterous war cries to Gale’s earnest reflections on his arcane affliction. Baldur’s Gate 3 masterfully blends player choice, memorable characters, and high-stakes drama into an RPG triumph. Whether you’re negotiating peace between factions or grappling with the fate of your own soul, the game delivers an experience you’ll revisit time and again.","May 12, 2025",steam

"10/10 – A Masterclass in Storytelling, Freedom, and Chaos Baldur’s Gate 3 isn’t just a video game — it’s an experience that completely redefines what role-playing means. From the very first dice roll, it feels like stepping into a living, breathing Dungeons & Dragons campaign with the best dungeon master imaginable. Every character, choice, and consequence feels handcrafted with care, depth, and humor. You start as a nobody infected with a mind flayer parasite, and before you know it, you’re leading a ragtag band of misfits through one of the most immersive worlds ever built. The writing is sharp and layered — funny when it wants to be, dark when it needs to be, and emotional when you least expect it. Every companion has a backstory that feels worth exploring, and the relationships you build (or ruin) genuinely matter. The freedom of choice is mind-blowing. You can fight your way through every obstacle, sweet-talk your enemies into helping you, or just… throw a pair of boots at someone and see what happens. You can romance half your party (and probably regret it later), betray your allies, or save the world through sheer luck and questionable decisions. Almost everything you think of trying — the game lets you do. Combat is deep but approachable. Turn-based battles feel tactical and satisfying, and the environment plays a huge role — whether you’re pushing people off ledges, lighting grease on fire, or turning into a gas cloud to sneak past danger. It rewards creativity and punishes recklessness in the most entertaining ways possible. And then there’s the presentation — breathtaking visuals, incredible voice acting, and a musical score that perfectly captures every moment. The game feels alive. NPCs react to your actions, the world changes based on your choices, and even minor side quests can turn into full-blown adventures. It’s not just about beating the game — it’s about living through it. You’ll laugh, you’ll rage, you’ll reload saves you swore you wouldn’t, and when the credits finally roll, you’ll sit there in silence wondering what would have happened if you’d made just one different choice. After hundreds of hours, I can confidently say this: Baldur’s Gate 3 isn’t just one of the best RPGs ever made — it’s one of the best games ever made, period. Verdict: A critical hit in every category. Don’t just play it — live it.","Nov 11, 2025",steam
There is so much you can do in this game. One could play it multiple times and discover new things every time. Now I don't have that kind of time to waste though as one play trough took nearly 200 hours as it is. One day I may start it over again to experiment with a different class or go for new a new ending etc. I love that it is a complete game and is actually well done unlike most games that come out these days. I love that my choices actually matter as well. I also normally hate turn based games and it was a bit of a struggle for me to figure out the battle mechanics but I really enjoyed the story so I learned and ended up enjoying it. The only thing I don't like is how things go towards the end. Without spoiling anything your basically forced to do something I really didn't want to do because I didn't have OP stats and I feel like it is also something most players would not want.,"Dec 30, 2024",steam

"The best thing you can do for yourself is change the settings of the game to make it so that you can't save it over and over again, because if we're being honest with ourselves, we're just going to keep getting to a point where we want to start a new game before the first play through we started is over. There's SOOOO much good content, Rp and seemingly random things going on that it's impossible to fight the urge to look up other people's play-through's, ask the internet if you're making a good choice or choosing the right items or companions for an interaction that you can't really blame yourself if you spend 5hrs in game (out of game) looking at an IGN article about if the helmet is better than the shield or if this NPC can be saved. There's a reason most people have over 100 hrs in this game and I can assure you it is both enriching and concerning. The only thing that my family and I didn't like was the POV, because we're used to being able to look up at the sky when ever we want, but that's a personal preference and not an issue with the game. I just wanted to express empathy for anyone who's not used to top down 3rd person (people who don't regularly play (LOL and Dota) type games ) getting into this one with a misconception that the majority of the game outside of combat will be different. This obvious assumption is made by the fact most places only show cut-scenes, low angle 3rd person and FPOV's over all when sharing content. The only image that is largely accurate on the steam page for example (without forcing the camera) is the cursed forge image where the characters look like they're far away. The good news is you can get used to the angle after 9hrs of play time. Would recommend, don't feel shy about making the settings what you want/need them to be so that you can enjoy this awesome story telling experience.","Sep 21, 2025",steam

This should be a different category because this is not game of the year worthy. The start of the game was with no tutorial, no story, and just dropped me there and said go on play.

Dragon Commander, DOS 1 and of course DOS 2 so good! The Lore is confusing but still bloody fun. I purchased this game in ye olden days of Early access and i thought maybe 60 bucks is too much for EA but i trusted the Studio and i was not disappointed EVEN THOUGH so much jank in those early days i knew something magical was happening (pun intended) You had a lot of freedom and then after sinking many hours into ACT 1 mind you. I would put it down and then play it After every new update i always watch the streams. Sven and the Team have a great sense of humor THE SALAMI. Also Sven is a Discworld Fan so another point. Fast forward Game is released i started a new run as Tav a Half-Orc Sorcerer with a past of being poor and street smart. THE AMOUNT OF LOVE that went into this game is amazing and the level of choice you can do and Speak with the Dead. OWLBEAR AND DOGGO don't get me started on the writing its bloody fantastic the people you choose to travel with don't feel like video game peoples but Actual Characters with their own wants and motivations lots of love went into these performances and Astarion's Voice Actor winning the Game of the Year Award is well deserved. This notion that we shouldn't expect games from other major Devs of this love and quality is just where the AAA industry is currently at rn they care more about profit margins, a formula instead of trying something new. Svens speech was always on spot on and like he said you make games that the Devs love to play people will buy it. Instead of chasing Trends stop being so safe. Also enough with Celebrities in Video Games its distracting (Except Johnny Silverhand and Idris Elba) they are awesome and ofc JK simmons. BUY THIS GAME","Dec 24, 2024",steam

"It's a total masterpiece! I could go on and on about how much I love it, but saying it's a masterpiece really sums it up nicely. I played the original 2 games when they were new, and have replayed them a couple of times. This is a great way to continue the series, Larian did an amazing job. It does feel like I'm playing a game related to Divinity: Original Sin, but that's a great thing because I loved those games too. My one an only complaint was the way one original character was handled - it was enough to make me rage a little bit, but that's also how invested I was in this game and characters. Seriously, this game is fun, creative, smart, difficult without being annoying, and full of things to keep you hooked.

"Character customization is the best I've ever seen. Got punked by grandma and ended up with the Mushroom guys. 10/10 so far edit 45hrs: This game is awesome. Brilliant balance between combat, exploration, and dialogue so you don't have to grind one activity to progress. My only two hangups are dice rolls and turn based combat aren't a draw for me but literally everything else makes up for it (characters with unique lines that carry emotion. motivation, and raison-detre as well as updating reactions to story beats and decisions that feel natural including banter while just exploring) , (all the cool spells and attacks with intuitive and easy to use interact wheels on controller, where controller compatibility is usually the biggest yay or nay), TLDR: I skipped the hype but this one earned the praise.

"Score: ★★★★★ (5/5) — Still finding new reasons to love it after 165 hours. With over 165 hours of playtime, in early access and now full release, I can confidently say I’m still nowhere near done with this game. Every session offers new opportunities for joy, creativity, and immersion. It has easily become one of my comfort games, the kind I can always return to and lose myself in. Now, I’ll admit that Act 1 has gotten a bit boring for me at this point, simply because I’ve played through it so many times. But even then, I can’t deny the incredible attention to detail, character depth, and the sheer number of choices that can shift your story in surprising ways. That “your choice matters” gameplay has always been one of my favorite mechanics, and BG3 does it better than almost any RPG I’ve played. Overall, Baldur’s Gate 3 is a masterpiece that continues to grow with every update. If you enjoy immersive storytelling, role-playing freedom, and a developer that truly listens to its community, you’ll find yourself right at home here, just like I did.","Oct 20, 2025",steam

"Okay, wow, where to start? After a year I finally managed to pick it back up and finish the last of Act 3. When it had first came out I had been completely obsessed. I did every mission I could find, searched every crate, played around by trying different choices (admittedly a bit of savescumming on my behalf). And I remember it being so much fun. The characters (and the amazing voice acting), the world building, the choices. Any other review can probably tell you just how this game excells in everything. The only miniscule ""complaint"" I could possibly have is the fact Act 3 is so huge, and not super structured, so I had to do a bit on research on the correct order of doing things to not miss anything. I think since it was such an overwhelming amount of content, past me just couldn't keep up with it at the time because of exams. I'm kind of a perfectionist, so picking it back up where I could barely remember what I last did felt a bit difficult. But god was it worth it. The story ended beautifully (I went for a good playthrough), and the satisfaction it gave me to finally complete my first playthrough was inmense. The nostalgia (from when I last played and enjoyed this game) and all the fun I had had was one I wish to repeat. An emotional breath of fresh air that even someone who knows nothing about DnD can learn to love just as much. So glad it got game of the year award in 2024, definetely deserved. I recommend it 100%, and will likely in the future begin another playthrough as dark urge instead (there's way too much replayability not to!). Definitely one of my favourite games.","Jan 09, 2026",steam
"Wow, just wow. This was my first time ever playing a turn-based RPG and I didn’t know anything about D&D going into this. I usually play games like GTA, FIFA and shooters, so I did not expect to like or understand this game. I was wrong. The first hours were hard. I did not understand the fighting mechanics and I was close to giving up. As you can see from this review, I did not.. I decided to play a little bit more, and 2 hours turned into 5 hours, and 5 hours turned into 50 hours, and 50 hours to 100 hours…. This is the best story I have ever experienced in a game. All the choices, mistakes and accomplishments matters and I am able to craft my own story. How is it even possible to make a game where there is a story line for ever possible outcome? I can’t wrap my head around how much time and passion the developers must have put in to this. I played it for so long and did so many quests, but I still feel like I just scratched the surface of the game, and I am ready to play it again and do things differently. I usually never want to play the story from a single-player game more than once, but I feel like I can play this 5 more times and have completely different experiences and outcomes. I still don’t understand half of it, and the game is hard, but that is just fine. There is so much to learn, so many more stories to experience. I finally understand why so many people like these type of games. 10/10! Btw, remember to backup save all the time! I learned that the hard way…","Sep 25, 2023",metacritic

The FREEDOM that the game let's you do is amazing and I love the dice roll mechanics to change the outcome of what happens to the quests and story. I can already imagine the replay value this game has, I've played a lot of skyrim with many different classes and never got bored doing the same quests, Baldurs gate 3 takes it to a whole other level when you develop relationships with npcs. Astarion, Karlach and Shadowheart are companions that I absolutely adore. All the hype from this game got me **** in and I do not regret it one bit. It is truly a breathtaking game that redefines the RPG genre. Game of the Decade without a doubt. There are just too many words for me to come up with to justify this masterpiece. It is truly a title that deserves all its praise and its studio, staff and voice actors. If you haven't played it, don't think, just get the game, you will be instantly hooked on it this is an experience that should never be missed.","Jan 7, 2024",metacritic

"This game is the perfect example of what can be achieved when game devs prioritize producing something filled with love and passion. Graphics are beautiful, story line is fantastic, and the re-playability is *chefs kiss*. I went into this game with minimal knowledge of D&D and the previous Baldur's Gate games, and still had a blast playing 1.5 runs through the game, at the time of this review. My best advice, ignore all the negative reviews for this game. Reading through them myself has left me with the opinion of ""Skill issue"". Bunch of kiddo's complaining that the game is too hard and can't beat act 1, with 100+ hours of play time. Like, what were you doing in all that time? Seriously, gamer's are so use to the micro transaction predatory slop that modern gaming has become, it seems like when a product is produced out of love, with the soul purpose of just being fun. They can't put the effort in to actually play it for joy. Seriously, one of the negative reviews said ""math is too hard"", are you kidding me? Go touch grass, do better.","Feb 16, 2025",steam
"Only had the game for a couple of weeks and over 100hrs in. When my bro suggested it, I was like “meh..role-play.. not my thing”. But then I thought, “Well, I used to play Tunnels and Trolls and D&D when it first came out, so I wonder what it’s like on ps5” So, so glad I did. The mix of turn based and group movement make the game move along smoothly. I find the coma at fun and challenging. I normally steer away from magic as I’m a hack’n’slash kinda guy, but here it’s necessary and enjoyable to use. However,, what makes this game stand out for me are the depth of the character choices and the way that decisions really do have significant repercussions in the game going forward. Character and group decisions mean you have to approach combat scenarios based on your party skills, allowing for multiple playthroughs (however, I’m still in Act 2 after 110hrs). But the main thing is the writing and scenario design. Some encounters are beautifully designed with stunning graphics; some are really challenging; and some are really funny. The behind-the-scenes dice rolling is seamless meaning some traps reallydo take you by surprise. The characters have real depth; so that some that I didn’t warm to at the start are now my favourites (take care though, my bro was a bit careless in his early interactions and two of his party upped sticks and left for good!). I would definitely say this is the most pleasantly surprised I have ever been about a game..ever (well, that I remember.. Silent Hill 1 was a long time ago!). Add to that the continued support and updates from the devs and this, for me, is the one absolutely must have game on next-gen. It has something for everyone. I haven’t tried multiplayer yet, as I like to do first play through alone; so still got that to look forward to. A masterpiece imo; and a bargain at the price.","Nov 3, 2023",metacritic

"The different narratives, small and large, and how well interwoven they are with each other, makes this game one of the best story-driven experiences I have ever had. The gameplay is perhaps not for everyone, and has somewhat of a learning curve, but figuring things out can be equally frustrating and satisfying once everything clicks and your party starts ripping through groups of enemies when significantly outnumbered. All in all, a 10/10. P.S. I never pre-order games, but it is safe to say the next game from Larian will have my money the first time they ask for it, regardless of it's early access, founders pack or whatever.","Aug 08, 2025",steam

"[Edit2] I've tried a halfling, they have a perk, that if they roll a 1, they reroll the dice. It turns out it also rerolls damage. Imagine how surprised I was, when it turned out that during entire nautiloid location (with killing the cambion commander) where I rolled dmg 15 times, the game rerolled it 14 times. Let that sink in. That means I've got 1 in 14 out of 15 damage rolls - the one not rerolled was a 2 :) [Edit] The fix mentioned later in this review seems a shortterm one - It looks like the rolls broke again after about 8 hours of playing - I again am rolling 2-3 critical misses in a row, again hit 2 out of 7 times with 70% accuracy - and before the church of perception bias arrives: other games don't do that on my PC, only this game, and it doesn't really do that on normal difficutly, only on ""tactician"", which has nothing to do with actual tactics, since 70% hit chance doesn't mean 70% at all, but more like 15-20%. [End of Edit] First things first: I (over)paid the full price for this game, I've finished the game and understand mechanics. I wish I was on recieving end of money that went into pockets of content creators who shilled for this bad game. This game is bad on one hand and boring on the other. The single thing that it more or less does well is exploration, everything else is bad and boring. OST is ruinning immersion. The fighting song is like ""BOOOBOBOBABIIII BIBIBIOOO"" - like, are we fighting, or trying to help a toddler to utter their first words? BUGS everywhere - interestingly, the longer I play, the more of them appear and more ridiculous they are. I started a new run and triggers went off badly, so I couldn't skip a cutscene and each scene was played 3 times in a row (reloading game didn't fix this). After finishing the game on balanced I've went for tactician and suddenly it turned out that having 75+% hit chance makes me land 1 in 8 hits, getting critical fails 2-3 times in a row every second turn, while my enemies who have 25% hit chance were hitting me 9 out of 12 times, getting at least one crit every turn. First I thought it's RNG cheating coz of difficulty, but when I verified files for the game it fixed itself and I no longer get utter nonsense from RNG - which shouldn't happen. Somehow this game destroys itself when you play it. Fights are incredibly boring. Creators of the game don't respect your time at all - you have turnbased fights (what is it? 1994? where's active pause?) which can't be sped up and take ages (AI sometimes hangs and you have to reload the fight) and fights often have meaningless mobs that just artificially make them longer. Speaking of making things artificially longer, you have to throw a k20 dice for almost everything and A LOT of these are direct rolls, where UI animates the roll - what is this nonsense? there's literally no other reason, than to fake that the game has much more content than it really does. Another thing is the team-UI, which is basically nonexistant. How is it possible, that even indie games do it properly, but this ♥♥♥♥ game has NO party features? This makes traps and lockpicking even more time consuming, tedious and boring than it naturally is, because if you don't play as a rogue, you have to select your rouge manually and order him to lockpick or disarm after rightclicking a box or trap - the UI isn't smart enough to send the best hero for the task nor to know you want to lockpick a locked chest or disarm a trap - ridiculous! Legendary items are +3 -BORING AND PATHETIC! Character leveling is designed to give you depression : there's basically no choices to make except for picking specialty at level 3. Levleups do almost nothing, but for whatever reason lvl5 more than doubles your hero's power, with most classes having some cherry on the top imba mechanic on lvl6 which is just awful design. Unless you play a spellcaster at which point ""awful"" gets into new quality. Woah, look 4 goblins, lets kill them! Oh, oops, now we have to long rest, because casters no longer have spells :(. BOOOOOORRRRIIINNNNGGGGG!!!! Nothing makes sense in this game, people who made these mechanics never touched grass. You can jump up to a place, but jumping down makes you take damage, while jumping down is easier than jumping up to something. wtf? and another example: woah, I have 22 strength? Time to pick up this dude and throw him at his friends - well, yes, but the range is tiny - oh, ok, I guess you need big big strenght then. Oh look a dragon! how strong is it? 26 strenght. And no, these don't increase exponentially. And no, odd values don't do anything. There's basically no difference between 20 and 21 strenght. 26 strength lets a dragon carry it's gigantic body around in a swift fashion, but 22 won't let you toss an enemy from one side of the screen to another. there are 4 stairs between you and your target? well now you can't shoot an arrow through these door until you walk these 4 stairs. You're at a highground? well tough ♥♥♥♥, because some highground prevent you from shooting down. You can miss a statue that can't move (and not through critical miss). You sneaked up on that enemy and want to do a stealth kill? shame, coz you've MISSED this mob that wasn't moving nor defending itself :D Almost all feats are useless, while other few are just straight imbalanced (like tavern brawler). Almost all items are trash. (yeah, the game is boring). There's no facilities for looting - if there's 20 enemies dead, you need to go to each of them separately and loot bodies 20 times. All items are clickable, which means - you've guessed it - microing looting of ♥♥♥♥ from crates, which should be automated becuase it's 2025. A d20 roll can separate you from content FOREVER. A buggy trigger can separate you from content FOREVER or even KILL YOUR HONOUR RUN! Now that's great isn't it? Monk is imbalanced. Giant berserker is imbalanced. Arcane archer is imbalanced - and there are actually even more imba things in the game. You basically have the same level for the entire team, but not exactly. If your main hero gets a level earlier, just tell your companion to wait in camp and then rejoin - they get the levelup. You get the same amount of exp no matter how many companions you have, so what's the point of them having separate exp bars? This means if you're solo, you don't get more exp, which is SOOO BOOOOOORING! lvl12 is max and you will never get any hero development above that. I had lvl12 somewhere at the beginning of act 3 and I know that minmaxing you can get even to lvl 11 before act2. Surprise mechanics are bugged and nonsense since you can force the entire enemy pack to be surprised by a single unit from your pack, even if they joined the fight unsurprised. I don't remember a game disappointing me this much and a lot of it is the absurd price for it and the all the lies about what a great game this is. It is not. It's a SCAM! Somehow Tyranny could make it's mechanics to be modern and exciting ( even the spellcasting ). I thought that Colony Ship is the most terrible RPG I've played with most annoying mechanics, but I was wrong. If you treat Colony ship as a tactics challenge for fighting, then it's actually fun, becuase you can be creative with how you build your character when it levels up and moreover it's FUN that you can get a single character run and leverage that bit of extra exp. Again, I don't even get scammed this hard by politicians from my corrupt government. It doesn't even get close to the SCAM this game is.","May 25, 2025",steam

"I was trying to come up with a critique of BG3 but all I could think was in how I could kick a squirrel down the forest. Despite what most people say, I wouldn't recommend the game to just ANYBODY. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece. The story in its moment to moment can be very corny, you won't completely shake off the feeling that you a playing in a homebrew D&D campaign which can undermine its more serious moments. The party limit of 4 instead of the standar 6 feels pretty restrictive. Just 12 levels seems pretty low, which I didn't mind since I figured out that Larian would follow the BG tradition of making an expansion that would fill the missing levels until you learn that the studio is not interested in pursuing further content outside of what a patch can provide. What really shines is the moment to moment gameplay and the sheer comedy effect that just get multiplied when you play with friends. And if you are a newcomer, I think that all the negatives you can pull from the game won't matter as much and some will even help you out get into RPGs with things like having the more manageable party of 4, more comprehensible level cap of 12 and the fact the navegation feels more like an exploration game rather than a top-down RPG. Let me put you this way: If you want a RPG with a good story that takes itself serious and makes you ponder about it narrative and characters, play Planescape Torment of the Pillar's of Eternity games. If you want sheer content with dozens of classes, with many options to build your party and be able to reach your power fantasy, play the Pathfinder Games or BG1 & 2. If you want to have a fun with your friends or you want to play a good-looking rpg with a lot of production value and a bunch of tools to let you break havoc in the forgotten realms, get BG3. You won't regret it.","Feb 04, 2025",steam

"Giving this a 5 because I’m only able to play half of the game due to Larian updating the game with a patch that completely broke Act 3. The lag is insane taking 30sec to a minute for NPC and party members to respond (this is offline, mind you), then you move your character a bit and it happens again, and again, and again. Crossing the lower city is a half hour exercise in pure frustration. Some encounters actually cause the game to crash altogether, and that’s not a one-off. I’ve had the same encounter crash the game on my PS5 4 times. I tried deleting and reinstalling the game - no change. The first half of the game was great fun and I’ve played it through twice, but then running into game-breaking performance issues upon arriving in Baldur’s Gate has ruined my initial impression of the game. To add insult to injury, more than 2 weeks after that game-breaking patch Larian has yet to comment on it in the media, their own forums, or anywhere else despite a large player outcry. So now I’ve spent money on a game the developer’s actions have prevented me from completing and that same developer has nothing to say. I’ll think twice before buying any title from Larian in the future.","Nov 22, 2023",metacritic

The amount of variety in the classes and comps you can choose from will have you wanting to play the game multiple times. The music and voice acting is top tier.

It is a masterclass in storytelling, character design, and player-driven narrative. Every decision feels meaningful, every companion is deeply written, and every playthrough offers something new. Larian Studios has set a new benchmark for what modern RPGs can and should be. As someone who has spent hundreds of hours exploring every dialogue option, quest path, and companion arc, I can confidently say this is one of the most polished, emotionally rich, and technically impressive games I’ve ever played. The attention to detail, from the cinematic cutscenes to the reactive world design, is nothing short of stunning. Whether you are a long-time fan of D&D or completely new to the genre, BG3 welcomes you with open arms and delivers an unforgettable journey. I laughed, I cried, I couldn't stop playing. This game will stay with me for a very long time. Absolutely recommended.","Aug 06, 2025",steam

"Look, I love this game, at this time I have over 80 hours in it and I haven't yet finished Act I because there's so much goodness to explore. I just wish it had the cooldowns from Divinity: Original Sin games instead of the ""once per round / encounter / short rest / long rest"" stuff which actually makes me use all the skills less. It's the same issue as saving potions just in case I really need them later, except it's with all the skills. It's D&D so it has to be like that, otherwise the creators would get slowly roasted over a nice fire, I get it. There are now mods that should help with this, I just haven't had a chance to try those out yet. Will update afterwards. UPDATE: Using mods helps. I'm using more skills and spells now, and having a lot of fun. I just find the overall fighting system inferior to what DoS2 had. I miss using the many elements and their combinations. In DoS2 you could throw everything you had at the enemy and still have a good challenge. Here if you throw everything, it's too easy. So that's my main complaint - you have less to do and you have to hold yourself back. Still very good, though, and the story, the world and the characters elevate it. If it had the same freedom in the fights as DoS2 (or, honestly, if they just made DoS3), it would, for me, be the best game I've ever played.","Aug 12, 2025",steam

"As a crpg fan, baldur's gate 3 is nothing for me where the likes of fallout 1 & 2, arcanum, geneforge and many more exist. But kudos to larian who laid their groundwork from divinity series and executed the basic tropes of crpg well showing the world what true roleplaying is in video games. I was skeptical at first because it deviated lot from the infinity engine games but larian learned all their tricks and made baldur's gate 3 their magnum opus.

"This game has fun combat, engaging characters and plenty of opportunity to go your own way. Honestly, this is what Witcher 3 pretended it was from a story and execution perspective. Your choices actually matter and the dialogue is interesting and doesn't overstay its welcome. FYI, one thing to know is that being a barbarian or sword swinging character is a death sentence in this game. Every enemy party has wizards or ranged combat and mercs you endlessly. It's unfortunate, as the enemy parties have no variety, they're all OP adventuring groups that feel like you're playing PvP instead of PvE, which is a huge negative. Not every race should have a full class roster when you fight them. However, the game is still very good and I highly enjoyed it. Again, I warn you to pick a ranged class of some sort if you want a chance to get through the early game without wasting hours on the game over screen.","Nov 09, 2025",steam
"The review percentages are clear, 5% of people who played this game have no taste. This game is what happens when you take a team that knows what they are doing and couple them with a publisher that is also them so no one can get in their ass and make stupid choices. I got wrapped up in trying to create the perfect character for me, took like 12 times starting over, still had fun with every play through. Even when I found the one I liked I still wanted to make more, do something different. Then the game play, amazing! The story? Sweet baby jesus! Its amazing, even stuff thats not part of the story, little snippets, amazing! This game is amazing! Beyond that, so is Larian. Their backstory is amazing, and while their games have always been, you can clearly see why when they started dropping publishers and making games for gamers. I hope this company never sells, they may be one of the last few companies with any integrity. Check out their backstory. Finally, and most importantly, (at least to me) they don't shave away from adult themes while doing so tastefully, or not tastefully in the best ways. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll explode enemies left and right! Do right by yourself, and the squirrel, and get this game!","Feb 11, 2025",steam

I'm now on my third playthrough and about 380 hours and don't plan on quitting any time soon!

"I went into this game with some hesitation. I’d never played a turn-based D&D game before, and coming from games like Skyrim, I thought immersion meant real-time combat and full freedom of movement. BG3 completely changed how I see that. I’ve spent over ten hours barely leaving the starting area—not because the game is slow, but because there’s so much happening everywhere. Every conversation feels worth having, every place feels like it has a story, and the game actually trusts you to figure things out instead of holding your hand. Curiosity constantly pays off in ways I didn’t expect. What really surprised me is how heavy the choices feel. For the first time in an RPG, the main threat doesn’t feel like something you can just ignore while doing side quests. It’s always in the back of your mind, and it made me genuinely anxious about what I should do next. I even felt tempted to look things up, before realising that the uncertainty is part of the experience. This isn’t a game where the world bends around you. Your actions matter, your approach matters, and things don’t always work out the way you expect. Baldur’s Gate 3 doesn’t just let you play a role—it makes you live with it. Easy 10/10. One of the most immersive RPGs I’ve ever played - and I've barely started Act I.","Jan 04, 2026",steam

"Nice game, very choice and consequence, not illusion of choice. Loads of Dialogue and the voice acting is great. The characters are memorable, even the annoying ones,(looking at you, Shadowheart). Combat is full of depth, but it does get a bit slow when theres a lot of people waiting for their turn. Thats the nature of turn based combat, gives you time to think, but is a bit sluggish. If you dont mind that, besides occasional wierd pathing issues, or how hard it is to walk or aim trough a doorway, its a nice time. Very good game. Instant classic. If you are willing to learn its ways, this game has much to offer. Be the good guy, or be a baddie, or be anyone in between.","Feb 10, 2025",steam

I've of course played Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 multiple times. BG3 is a more than worthy entry to the genre. It's a fantastic game in every way: the story, gameplay, music, visuals - all of it is brilliant. I'm going to be replaying this game for many years to come.

MY. GOD. is it fun, hell. ALL the classes are fun, ive been messing around with the starter characters (except gale, because i find him to be insufferable) and their storylines and classes are SO. FUN. i cannot stress that enough. i have played hundreds of games before, and this is EASILY the best one. (then cyberpunk 2077 and red dead redemption 2) However, if your not into turn based RPGs and sinking your teeth into the world, this game probably isnt for you - there isnt really any ""best class"", all of them have their pros and cons. one tip i have to say is. PAY ATTENTION TO THE WORLD!! it is genuinely one of the best parts of the game. one tip i have to say is: dont pay attention to builds!! its too much to worry about. of course, if you find a cool new weapon but you already have a cool weapon, check which one would be better for you to use..... anyways, im gonna continue playing this absolute godsend of a game","Apr 17, 2025",steam

"An amazing game and a labor of love that is rare to find in today's AAA gaming environment. Baldur's Gate 3 is a great adaption of the D&D 5th edition rules and Forgotten Realms lore built into a turn based RPG that you can play alone or with friends. It also feels like a great improvement over Larian Studios previous stellar game Divinity Original Sin 2. While those who are expecting gameplay other than turn-based combat or the rules/mechanics to be more akin to Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 may be disappointed, this remains a faithful Baldur's Gate experience full of environments to explore and quests to complete in a multitude of ways. Larian has out done themselves with updating and supporting the game to allow players to creatively approach the game. The cherry on the top is the music and voice acting that carry the game to a higher level of immersion. The only minor complaint I have had is sometimes trying to approach a fight with multiple characters separated from each other and having no real way to pause the fight to let them all jump in with a surprise attack. If the first one to attack rolls low and the enemies do not get the surprised status, they'll begin to attack the one character and possibly spot your other party members, forcing them to roll initiative and enter combat.","Dec 05, 2024",steam

Writing will make you do a soy face if you're using reddit/twitter, otherwise will make you cringe at best or just skip everything at worst Companions will try to romance the main character even if you didn't do anything, they call you a bad guy/girl if you refuse them This game its a ""masterpiece"" if you never touched more than 5 RPG's in your entire life or any CRPG","Aug 16, 2023",metacritic

"This game is a fantastic mix of gorgeous and entertaining. The story is top notch, the character interactions are phenomenal, and the gameplay is amazing! I love it, I love the variety, the replayability, the sheer amount of choices means unless you actively try, you'd never have the same playthrough twice. Always finding new little areas on different playthroughs too!","Jul 02, 2025",steam
"This game is addictive. Be warned. I genuinely cannot get enough of it. The entire cast is incredible. The world is immersive and vast. If you like D&D even a little bit, I would absolutely recommend this game. 10/10.","Jan 18, 2026",steam

"Shadowheart must I say more. All seriousness this is one of the greatest games I have ever played. The story is solid it doesn't compare to Red dead Redemption 2 or Witcher 3 in my opinion but it is engaging enough to drive you to the end. The thing that makes this game just truly amazing is the characters. Almost all of them are amazing characters with impactful personalities, stories and multiple ways to romance the characters and lead them down good, grey or bad paths and I love it. Being able to change and fix characters like Shadowheart, Astarion, Gale and lae'zel and make them great people is amazing. The combat system is crispy. You think the turn based action would damage the game but it makes the game as it allows time to breath, think and plan. The graphics are stunning the character models are crazy good if not a tad sexuallized but damn who cares when literally every character is hot. The build crafting oh the build crafting if you liek making stupid op and or fun builds in all games BG3 does it the best. Overall this game at full price is great dont wait to play it buy it now and enjoy bliss.","Apr 29, 2025",steam

I love playing DnD but with my work i cant play very often so when i brought this up to one of my DnD friends he suggested this game. I am in love with it. I love the graphics and the way everything is set up. i would totally recommend this to not only DnD players but also people who love a story line.,"Jan 03, 2026",steam
"I have finished act 2 with two separate characters using good and bad paths, and the amount of freedom is insane. If you play RPGs then buy this game. There is a scale to your choices, not just good or bad, great worldbuilding, great voice acting, great combat like dos2, the writing is awesome, there isn't any political message, good character development, companions aren't just pawns, build versatility is crazy good and to top it all off the game looks great.","Aug 9, 2023",metacritic

It’s a long game, so I wouldn’t recommend it to someone who doesn’t enjoy reading or spending time with the story—every damn minute is worth it. I’ll definitely play again to keep discovering new endings. You can feel the passion and love from every person involved in the project. The creators were—and still are—so thoughtful about the user experience, especially as new players join. I didn’t know I loved role-playing games until I played this one.","May 26, 2025",steam

"Product received for free As a big fan of medieval fantasy, turn-based strategy, role-playing, tabletop campaigns, character creation & customization, social sims, gathering & crafting, exploration of vivid & immersive settings & worlds, stories of heroism & the battle between various forces, beating up cultists, and someone who genuinely enjoys inventory management, this game ticks so many boxes for things I enjoy. Extremely easy to get lost in the world & characters, to just wish to replay the story over and over, to experience things anew in different order of doing things, character backgrounds & party make-ups, decisions & dialogue choices, to forget about any and all other games and hobbies one might be interested in! Especially given how much your decisions genuinely impact other things, both obviously, and discreetly, and often after a long time has passed as well. The main cast is charming with all their various quirks, and it's interesting to see how your decisions can impact the courses of their lives, for better or for worse, and it's so fun & rewarding being familiar with the setting and world from D&D, hearing about places & meeting characters you are familiar with. Lots of humor & hilarious moments, beautiful music, emotional & heartfelt conversations & decisions. Genuinely worth of all the hype, and a game I know I will keep coming coming back to again & again. Not to mention the hilarious & chaotic potential of co-op play! One of the best gifts I have gotten from a friend, and one I intend to pay forward to others as well. Definitely recommend this for others like me who enjoy games & series such as The Elder Scrolls, Dragon Age, Final Fantasy, and of course, those who enjoy tabletop games such as Dungeons & Dragons, Pathfinder, Ars Magicka, Victoriana.","May 08, 2025",steam
"The game repeatedly deletes my most recent saves, meaning every time I boot up I have to redo the last hour or more of gameplay. In almost 28 hours I'm not even past the first major mission and have just met my 2nd to last party member. Its dice roller always fails a check unless I have stacked bonuses, then I get a nat 20, and every combat is a slog for the same reason. I could go on about the ""writing"" that reads like a 10 year old's first D&D campaign. How is every character a near legendry warrior that literally consorts with Gods on a first name basis of some sort, but are also level 1? Brain parasite might make sense for some but that's not how Warlocks, Clerics, or Paladins work. There's no moment to take a breath, it's a constant series of ""and then this happened, and then this happened, and then the REAL REAL BBEG shows up, and then this happened"" ad nauseum, and any attempt to actually exercise free will is either not an option, heavily discouraged, or outright punished. You're here to be the Good Guy (tm) who stops and helps everyone and everything along the way. The game is not fun or interesting, and I seriously cannot understand all the hype behind this bog standard generic ass CCRPG.","Jan 03, 2026",steam

"I've been playing video games for 30 years. I was really starting to lose hope that any developers or studios would ever push the envelope again. Take risks and challenge themselves. Listen to the players and release a video game worthy of our time and money. I can't really nail down ALL the reasons why Baldur's Gate 3 has enslaved me now going on 100 hours. I think it's the entire presentation. They get so many things right. And then they go out of their way to show you more. It just never stops. There's never a lull in the story or in the action. Never a period of just grinding out XP to level up by farming one location over and over again. They didn't just put a new coat of paint on the genre. This is the genre. In fact, I don't know if anyone has ever been making CRPGs correctly so you might be like me and have never experienced something like this. I haven't been this excited for the future of gaming in over a decade. I can't wait to see how other studios respond. The inter-connectivity between everything going on in this game borders on unsettling. Like you're being tricked or something. You get these moments where you're like, ""Hey, what . . wait a second??"" Like this one where I found a stray dog on the road guarding his master's dead body. My Druid could speak with animals and is very persuasive so we were able to talk the dog into coming back to our camp for food and shelter. He ended up staying and is just our dog now. But he found this red ball one random time when I was at camp and he had it in his mouth and I took it, then I used the throw command and the dog chased it. Pretty neat. Kudos. But then about 60 in-game hours later this happened. I'm on a main-line quest and I decide to go rogue. I break into this balcony and lock-pick the door from the outside. My party all crowd into the room and there's this un-dead dog barking and going crazy. The game cuts away to a list of prompts to see how I want to proceed.. And one of them reads ""Maybe you still have that red ball that Twitch was playing with."" AND I DID!! I had it with me throughout the whole game. I had the dog sniff it and then I rolled against my Animal Handling to try and calm him down all the way. Which failed after 6 attempted rolls and 3 save games. So I did have to murder that un-dead dog. But I couldn't believe that little red ball made such an unexpected appearance way later in the game. Its that connectivity between everything. Even things that don't relate or won't ever be in the same room together. That random chance, or forgetting something small, seeing coincidences and wondering if they mean something. That **** really makes this world feel like an actual place. Random connections and coincidences happen if life all the time. Never thought I'd see it in a game that felt this authentic. One last thing while I'm here. I was debating this so I rolled for it. Here we go. I've never done this before in any review. There are some games that I cherish dearly. I don't know if I've ever said this about any game. Maybe in a drunk conversation. SONIC FRONTIERS IS THE GREATEST F**KING GAME EVER!! FIGHT ME!!! But I've never truly believed that I had arrived at that conclusion with any game. And I believed I would live the rest of my life without ever making such a bold and ridiculous claim. However, Larien Studios has shown us otherwise. The impossible has been achieved. Baldur's Gate 3, in-my-opinion, is the greatest game ever made. That's a very opinionated and biased statement that is definitely worth debating so I'll leave that at that and finish with what I do know to be absolutely true. Baldur's Gate 3 is my favorite game of all time. Ever. This has been a stunning year in gaming. Might end up being the best year in gaming . . . ever. So Baldur's Gate 3 didn't have a blank slate of bored gamers with nothing great to play. Because there has been multiple instances of greatness this year. I think It's fitting that in a year filled with so many great titles, one of them would not only stand high above the rest, but make a play for all-time greatness. Now then, you people have wasted enough of my precious BG3 time. I really hope everyone enjoys this amazing and so very special game. If you don't, don't blame my review. Blame your parents.","Aug 24, 2023",metacritic

"Baldur's Gate 3 Guardian cutscene killed my mid-range computer. Hence - an obviously negative review. I will change it to a positive review if it doesn't kill my new one. Larian, it's been a couple of years now of players reporting hard crashes on all sorts of machines and systems. Does someone have to sue you before you guys actually look into it? I had a great time for 230 hours but now I'm down 2,500 USD and I am scared to play the game again after reading reports of destroyed PC's ranging from 10 year old work laptops to 2 month old 4090 baby beasts. I guess it's back to playing new games about 10 years after they come out for me, but PLEASE Larian. Do something about this. The game is so enjoyable, so it's just a travesty that you would let something like this go for so many years now. Whenever I get the new PC I will try to recover my files and crash reports from my old one and I will obviously send in a ticket to figure out what happened, but for now I feel like I had to voice this concern since not everyone has the money to risk the most important hardware in their home (as it is for many gamers) just because the issue is hard for you to pinpoint. I genuinely hope this issue eventually gets resolved and I can go back to wholeheartedly enjoying the game like I did before all this happened.","Jan 21, 2025",steam
