    "**Problem Statement:** Predict whether a student will complete an online course, framed as a **binary classification** task (Completed vs Not Completed).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation & Real-World Relevance:** Online learning platforms face high dropout rates \u2014 often exceeding 90% on MOOCs ([Onah et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.1.2402.0009)). Early identification of at-risk students enables targeted interventions (e.g., personalised reminders, additional support) that can significantly improve course completion rates and platform revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:** [Student Course Completion Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nisargpatel344/student-course-completion-prediction-dataset) \u2014 100,000 student-course enrolment records with 40 features covering demographics, course metadata, engagement behaviour, and payment details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Criteria:**\n",
    "- **Primary metric:** F1-Score \u2265 0.70 \u2014 chosen as a balanced metric for classification that weighs both false positives (unnecessary interventions) and false negatives (missing at-risk students).\n",
    "- **Secondary metrics:** ROC-AUC \u2265 0.75 and Accuracy \u2265 0.70 \u2014 to validate discriminative ability and overall correctness.\n",
    "- **Generalisation:** Cross-validation standard deviation < 0.02, indicating stable performance across data splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach:** Train and compare three supervised classifiers \u2014 Logistic Regression (interpretable baseline), Random Forest (non-linear ensemble), and Gradient Boosting (sequential boosting) \u2014 then tune the best performer using GridSearchCV and validate with Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation.\n",

    "- **Course_Level:** Beginner courses may have slightly different completion rates than Advanced, which aligns with the intuition that course difficulty affects completion.\n",
    "- **Category:** Different course categories (Programming, Business, etc.) show minor variation, suggesting the subject matter has a small influence.\n",

    "1. The dataset has 100,000 rows and 40 columns with **no missing values** \u2014 it is pre-cleaned.\n",
    "2. The target variable is **nearly balanced** (~49% Completed vs ~51% Not Completed), meaning accuracy is a valid metric and class imbalance handling (e.g., SMOTE) is unnecessary.\n",
    "3. `Progress_Percentage`, `Video_Completion_Rate`, and `Quiz_Score_Avg` show the **strongest visual separation** between completed and not-completed students \u2014 these engagement features will be most predictive.\n",
    "4. Most categorical features (Gender, Education_Level, etc.) show relatively uniform completion rates, suggesting **limited discriminative power from demographics alone**.\n",
    "5. Feature correlations are generally low, so **multicollinearity is not a concern**.\n",
    "6. Outliers are present but minimal (<5%), and we choose to retain them since tree-based models are robust to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset-Specific Constraint (referenced throughout):**\n",
    "The dataset contains **high-cardinality identifier columns** (`Student_ID`, `Name`, `City`) and **date strings** (`Enrollment_Date`) that could cause overfitting if included as features. Additionally, the data is **entirely pre-cleaned**, which while convenient, means we must **artificially introduce data quality issues** to practise real-world data preprocessing skills. We address this in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How this constraint influences our approach:**\n",
    "- In **Data Cleaning (Section 4):** We introduce and then clean missing values/duplicates to simulate real-world preprocessing.\n",
    "- In **Model Selection (Section 5):** The large dataset size (100K rows) rules out computationally expensive algorithms like SVM.\n",
    "- In **Conclusion (Section 9):** We acknowledge that results on this clean, synthetic-like dataset may not directly transfer to messier real-world educational data."

High-cardinality columns (`City`, `Course_Name`, `Course_ID`) are dropped.\n",

    "We apply **Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation** to assess model generalisation. Cross-validation provides a more robust estimate of model performance than a single train-test split by evaluating the model across multiple different data partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Stratified K-Fold?**\n",
    "- **Stratified** ensures each fold preserves the class distribution (~49/51%), preventing folds where one class is over-represented.\n",
    "- **K=5** folds provides a good balance between bias and variance of the performance estimate \u2014 too few folds (K=2) gives high variance; too many (K=20) is computationally expensive and can have high variance due to small test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we are assessing:**\n",
    "- **Consistency:** Low standard deviation across folds (< 0.02) indicates the model performs consistently regardless of which data is used for training vs testing.\n",
    "- **Overfitting:** If cross-validation performance is significantly lower than training performance, it signals overfitting."

    "### Decision Points Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Point 1 \u2014 Feature Encoding Strategy:**\n",
    "We chose a hybrid encoding approach (ordinal for ordered features, one-hot for low-cardinality nominal features, and dropping high-cardinality identifiers) instead of one-hot encoding everything. This was driven by the dataset constraint of having identifier-like columns and high-cardinality categoricals that would inflate dimensionality without improving predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Point 2 \u2014 Model Selection:**\n",
    "We chose Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting over SVM. The 100,000-row dataset makes SVM computationally expensive (O(n\u00b2) scaling), while tree-based ensembles scale linearly and handle mixed feature types naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset-Specific Constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary constraint is that this dataset is **pre-cleaned with no missing values**, which is unrealistic for real-world data science. We addressed this by intentionally introducing dirty data to practise preprocessing skills. Additionally, the **high-cardinality identifier columns** (Student_ID, Name, City) had to be carefully excluded to prevent overfitting. The **near-balanced target distribution** (~49/51%) meant standard accuracy was a valid evaluation metric and specialised imbalance-handling techniques (SMOTE, class weighting) were unnecessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How this constraint influenced our work:**\n",
    "- **EDA (Section 3):** We noted that the dataset's pre-cleaned nature is a limitation and identified the risk of including identifier columns.\n",
    "- **Data Cleaning (Section 4):** We introduced artificial dirty data to simulate real-world preprocessing challenges.\n",
    "- **Model Selection (Section 5):** The dataset size (100K rows) directly ruled out SVM and favoured scalable ensemble methods.\n",
    "- **Conclusion:** We acknowledge that model performance on this synthetic-like dataset may be optimistic compared to real-world educational data with genuine noise, missing values, and class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations & Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Potential data leakage:** `Progress_Percentage` may partially encode completion status. In production, we would need to verify this feature is available before the prediction is made (e.g., at the midpoint of a course, not at the end).\n",
    "2. **Generalisability:** The dataset appears synthetic or semi-synthetic (uniform distributions, no missing values). Real-world data would likely contain more noise and imbalance.\n",
    "3. **Feature interactions:** More complex feature engineering (e.g., polynomial features, interaction terms between engagement metrics) could potentially improve predictions.\n",
    "4. **Model explainability:** For production deployment, SHAP values could provide per-student explanations of why a specific prediction was made.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "The tuned Gradient Boosting model provides robust predictions of course completion. Key predictive features \u2014 particularly engagement metrics like `Progress_Percentage`, `Video_Completion_Rate`, and `Assignment_Completion_Rate` \u2014 can be used by course providers to:\n",
    "1. **Identify at-risk students early** through real-time monitoring of engagement metrics.\n",
    "2. **Trigger automated interventions** (e.g., reminder emails, mentor outreach) when predicted completion probability drops below a threshold.\n",
    "3. **Improve course design** by analysing which engagement factors most strongly influence completion in different course categories."
