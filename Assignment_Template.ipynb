    "## Brief Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook addresses the **binary classification** problem of predicting whether a student will **complete** or **not complete** an online course. The dataset (`Course_Completion_Prediction.csv`) contains **100,000 student records** with **40 features** spanning student demographics, course information, engagement metrics, and payment details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "Online learning platforms face significant challenges with course dropout rates, which impact both learner outcomes and platform revenue. Early identification of at-risk students enables **targeted interventions** \u2014 such as personalised reminders, mentoring, or adjusted content \u2014 that can improve completion rates. A reliable predictive model supports **data-driven decision-making** for course designers, instructors, and platform administrators.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "We define success for this project as:\n",
    "- **Primary metric:** F1 Score > 0.55 on unseen test data (balancing precision and recall for both classes).\n",
    "- **Secondary metric:** Accuracy above baseline (50.97% \u2014 the majority-class proportion). A model must outperform random guessing to be useful.\n",
    "- **Generalisation:** Cross-validation standard deviation < 0.02, indicating stable performance across data splits.\n",
    "- **Interpretability:** Feature importance analysis to understand which factors most strongly predict completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Points\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this analysis, two key decision points are documented where alternative approaches were considered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decision Point 1 (Feature Selection):** We chose to **drop high-cardinality categorical features** (Student_ID, Name, City, Course_ID, Course_Name, Enrollment_Date) rather than one-hot encoding them. One-hot encoding was considered but rejected because it would create thousands of sparse columns, leading to overfitting, increased computational overhead, and diminishing model interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Decision Point 2 (Feature Scaling):** We chose **StandardScaler over MinMaxScaler** for feature scaling. MinMaxScaler was considered but rejected because StandardScaler is more robust to the outliers identified during our EDA, as it centres data around zero with unit variance rather than compressing all values into a fixed [0, 1] range dominated by outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset-Specific Constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraint:** The dataset contains many **high-cardinality categorical features** (Student_ID, Name, City, Course_ID, Course_Name) that act as near-unique identifiers or have too many categories for effective encoding. This constraint limits the usefulness of these features and influenced our preprocessing, feature selection, and model interpretation. It is explicitly referenced in the EDA, model selection, and conclusion sections."

    "1. **Logistic Regression** \u2014 A linear model that serves as our **interpretable baseline**. It works well when features have linear relationships with the target. Given the moderate correlations observed in our EDA, it provides a useful benchmark. Its coefficients are directly interpretable.\n",

    "2. **Random Forest Classifier** \u2014 An **ensemble of decision trees** that captures non-linear relationships and feature interactions. Given our mix of numerical and encoded categorical features (resulting from the dataset constraint forcing us to drop high-cardinality features), Random Forest can learn complex patterns without requiring feature interactions to be specified manually.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Key findings from the comparison:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logistic Regression** performs competitively despite being the simplest model. This suggests that there are meaningful linear relationships between features and course completion. Its performance above the 50.97% baseline confirms the features carry predictive signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Random Forest** achieves comparable or slightly better performance due to its ability to capture non-linear interactions between features. As an ensemble method, it reduces the variance (overfitting) that plagues single Decision Trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Decision Tree** shows the lowest performance, consistent with overfitting \u2014 it fits the training data too closely and generalises less effectively than the ensemble approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observation on model similarity:** All three models achieve accuracy in the range of ~53\u201361%, which is a **dataset-specific insight**: it indicates that the predictive signal in the available features is modest. After dropping high-cardinality features (our dataset constraint), the remaining features provide a limited but consistent view of student behaviour. This ceiling effect is not a model failure but a reflection of the data's inherent predictability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Constraint Reference:** Due to our dataset-specific constraint (high-cardinality categorical features), we work with a reduced but cleaner feature set. The dropped features (Student_ID, Name, City, Course_ID, Course_Name, Enrollment_Date) might have contained useful information (e.g., certain cities or courses having higher completion rates), but encoding them was infeasible. The Random Forest model handles the remaining mixed feature types (numerical + encoded categorical) well, making it our choice for hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selection for tuning:** We select **Random Forest** for hyperparameter tuning because it achieves the best balance of performance and robustness, and its hyperparameters (n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split) provide meaningful levers for improvement."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we built and compared three classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree) to predict course completion status from the Course_Completion_Prediction dataset. The tuned Random Forest model was selected as the best performer after hyperparameter optimisation via GridSearchCV.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results Against Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "| Criterion | Target | Result | Met? |\n",
    "|-----------|--------|--------|------|\n",
    "| F1 Score | > 0.55 | ~0.59 (tuned RF) | \u2705 |\n",
    "| Accuracy above baseline | > 50.97% | ~60% | \u2705 |\n",
    "| CV Std Deviation | < 0.02 | ~0.003 | \u2705 |\n",
    "| Feature importance analysis | Completed | See Section 5.4 | \u2705 |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset-Specific Constraint Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contained many **high-cardinality categorical features** (Student_ID, Name, City, Course_ID, Course_Name) that acted as near-unique identifiers. This constraint was a key factor throughout the analysis:\n",
    "- **In EDA** (Section 3.5), we identified that these features had too many unique values to be meaningfully visualised or encoded.\n",
    "- **In preprocessing** (Section 4.4), we dropped these features rather than encoding them (**Decision Point 1**), preventing dimensionality explosion.\n",
    "- **In model selection** (Section 6), we noted that the reduced but cleaner feature set favoured ensemble methods like Random Forest that can handle mixed feature types effectively.\n",
    "- **In feature importance** (Section 5.4), we observed that the dropped features may have contained useful signals (e.g., location-based or course-specific completion patterns), representing a trade-off between model simplicity and potential predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Points Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decision Point 1 (Feature Selection):** Dropped high-cardinality features instead of one-hot encoding \u2014 prevented dimensionality explosion and overfitting while sacrificing potential location/course-specific patterns.\n",
    "2. **Decision Point 2 (Feature Scaling):** Used StandardScaler instead of MinMaxScaler \u2014 better handling of outliers identified during EDA, particularly important for Logistic Regression's gradient-based optimisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Engagement metrics** (quiz scores, video completion, assignment submissions) are the strongest predictors of course completion, suggesting that platforms should focus on engagement monitoring for early intervention.\n",
    "- All three models achieved similar moderate accuracy (~53-60%), indicating that the available features provide limited but real predictive signal. Improving predictions would likely require richer features (e.g., temporal patterns from login timestamps, content interaction sequences, or peer comparison metrics).\n",
    "- The **Assignment_Completion_Ratio** engineered feature contributed to predictions, validating the value of domain-informed feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **For platform operators:** Implement early warning systems based on engagement metrics (quiz scores, video completion, assignment submission rates) to identify at-risk students.\n",
    "2. **For future modelling:** Explore temporal features from Enrollment_Date, consider target encoding or embedding approaches for high-cardinality features (City, Course), and try gradient boosting models (XGBoost/LightGBM) for potentially improved performance.\n",
    "3. **For data collection:** Gather additional features such as prior course completion history, learning time patterns, and peer interaction quality to improve predictive accuracy."
